The motive for\u00a0the reported attack hasn't been immediately clear, however, the situation in\u00a0Myanmar has been extremely tense since\u00a0the escalation in\u00a0August 2017, when Rohingya insurgents attacked government security posts. The attacks prompted a response by\u00a0Myanmar\u2019s authorities, which resulted in\u00a0clashes and the deaths of\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0Rohingya, and forced thousands of\u00a0others to\u00a0flee to\u00a0Bangladesh. The situation has been harshly criticized by\u00a0the global community, which has called for\u00a0an end to\u00a0violence.

Advertisers of all stripes are vying for the attention of the 111 million viewers expected to tune in. The goal is to be the most-talked about ad over the water cooler -- or Slack chatroom -- come Monday morning.From Steven Tyler de-aging for Kia to Amazon's imagining of different voices for Alexa, here are 10 ads that are likely to be talked about. And if you're not interested in tuning it to watch the big game on Sunday, you can stream all of these ads ahead of time.------AmazonThe internet giant's founder, Jeff Bezos, stars in this 90-second comedic ad showing different celebrities including chef Gordon Ramsay, actress Rebel Wilson, singer Cardi B and actor Anthony Hopkins subbing in for the voice of Amazon's voice assistant Alexa.------BudweiserAnheuser-Busch dispenses with its usual Clydesdales and puppies and instead goes with a 60-second ad that depicts, to the tune of \"Stand By Me,\" the company's program to provide water to areas in need. ------Bud LightThe beer brand's recent ads have centered on a Game of Thrones-like universe that uses the meaningless-but-catchy phrase \"Dilly Dilly.\" Now, in a 60-second ad running in the second quarter, the brand introduces \"Bud Knight,\" a heroic character who is ambivalent about helping out in a battle.------Coca-ColaThe soda maker strives to include everyone in its 60-second ad: people of different ethnicities, someone in a wheelchair and a person who uses the they/them pronoun are all shot at various locations in Mexico clutching or drinking different varieties of Coke.------Doritos & Mountain DewThe two Pepsico brands have linked spots that show a lip-sync battle between Peter Dinklage, who lip syncs a Busta Rhymes song as a representative for Doritos Blaze, and Morgan Freeman, who lip syncs a song by Missy Elliott for Mountain Dew Ice. ------FebrezeProcter & Gamble's air freshener tackles toilet humor with a 30-second ad airing in the second quarter. It purports to be a documentary about Dave, whose \"bleep don't stink.\" The kicker: Since your Super Bowl party guests are a bunch of not-Daves, you might want to take other precautions against bathroom odor.------KiaThe automaker has enlisted Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler (who last popped up in a Skittles Super Bowl ad two years ago) to promote its Stringer sports car. In the ad, he drives backward so fast that he gets younger thanks to computer-generated magic. In a nod to advertising tropes, the ad also contains a subliminal message if you watch it backward; Kia helpfully provides this version online.------Michelob UltraThe Anheuser-Busch light beer brand has 30-second ads in the second and fourth quarters starring Chris Pratt . In one he runs and does yoga while singing along to \"I Like Beer,\" a remake of a country song from the 1970s.------PepsiThe soda maker calls back to its past Super Bowl advertising efforts with Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Celtics basketball player Kyrie Irving and Cindy Crawford in a 30-second ad airing right before the Justin Timberlake halftime show.------WeatherTechThe maker of car floor mats shows footage of its new factory being built in a 30-second ad in the first half of the game.

So what exactly has gone wrong in Germany\u2019s army? It emerged last week that the German military can\u2019t find enough money to fund a long-awaited modernization of its newest Puma infantry fighting vehicles \u2013 which to many didn\u2019t exactly come as a surprise. Indeed, the news added to a steady stream of stories describing how poorly the Bundeswehr is performing, both in peacetime and during overseas deployments in conflict zones. Local newspapers are full of accounts about combat aircraft that lack vital parts or suffer technical failures, tanks and armored vehicles that can\u2019t operate, or soldiers that sympathize with the Third Reich and its armed forces, the Wehrmacht. This defies the stereotypes many people have about the Germans, who are known for being ultra-organized and notoriously pedantic. They excel in engineering and technology, and their arms manufacturers ThyssenKrupp, Kraus-Maffei and Rheinmetall are in the top 100 of the world\u2019s defense contractors, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Moreover, the Germans are historically known for producing a fierce army during two world wars, and one which became a key NATO tool to protect Western Europe from the perceived threat of a Soviet offensive during the Cold War. Recent events have thrown the nation\u2019s military prowess into question, however, and beg the question: what exactly is wrong with the German military, and is it actually vanishing as a fighting force? In September 2014, the Bundeswehr sent a mechanized battalion to take part in NATO\u2019s wargames in Norway. It was later reported that the German unit, trained as part of NATO's Rapid Response Force, was short of small arms and night vision goggles, and its Boxer armored vehicles had no weapons at all. But the soldiers \u2013 in the best traditions of Teutonic genius \u2013 knew what to do. They took broomsticks, painted them black and mounted them on their Boxers\u2019 turrets to simulate 12.7mm heavy machine guns. German command tried to downplay the incident, insisting the soldiers didn\u2019t need the weapons at all. However, the broomstick-wielding German battalion quickly made headlines and left a lasting impression on the public \u2013 who didn\u2019t need to wait all that long until more revelations arrived suggesting that one of world\u2019s economic giants was turning into a military dwarf. In November of last year it became known that more than half of the Bundeswehr\u2019s tank fleet is unfit for service. Only 95 out of 244 Leopard 2 main battle tanks were said to be combat-ready, while the remaining tanks were either disarmed or lacked critical spare parts. Putting boots on the ground in hostile zones was also a tough task for Germany, as soldiers deployed as part of a UN mission to Mali ran into trouble with their armored vehicles, which have been forced out of action because of heat, dust and irregular terrain. The state of the German Air Force doesn\u2019t appear to be any better. In 2014, Spiegel magazine reported that a confidential defense paper described the Luftwaffe\u00a0der Bundeswehr \u2013 the\u00a0army's air arm \u2013 as being in catastrophic disrepair. Painting a grim picture, it said only seven of the 67 CH-53 transport helicopters were in top condition \u2013 including those used in Afghanistan at the time. Later, in 2016, the air force began to repeatedly ground its Cold War-era Tornado jets due to technical mishaps, including \u201cloose screws\u201d that threatened pilots\u2019 safety and poor cockpit lighting. Tragically, the poor condition of the aircraft fleet seems to have been a factor in an incident in August last year, when a Tiger attack helicopter crashed while on a combat mission in Mali, killing two pilots on board. The Defense Ministry admitted the helicopter had lost rotor blades and other parts 10 seconds before ramming into the Malian desert. The helicopter\u2019s full fuel tanks and weapons load turned it into a \u201cfireball,\u201d leaving no chance for the crew to survive. The stories of faulty equipment and failures aren\u2019t limited to tanks and grounded jets. German submariners, whose forbearers wreaked havoc on Allied convoys some 80 years ago, have similar problems, too. Last October, the German Navy\u2019s newest Type 212A submarine \u2013 said to be capable of navigating submerged for over two weeks without resurfacing \u2013 hit a rock during a diving maneuver off the Norwegian coast. The unfortunate incident effectively left Germany without its entire submarine fleet, as two other Type 212A vessels are undergoing scheduled maintenance and will be fit for deployment no sooner than the second half of 2018. Another two subs are also in need of repairs after suffering damage. It would be unfair to say that German military chiefs are doing nothing to fix their army. The Defense Ministry reportedly plans to spend some \u20ac100 million (US$124 million) on global consultancy firms, including the Big Four\u2019s Ernst & Young and KPMG, to make the army\u2019s logistics and procurement more efficient. The defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, has repeatedly said she is determined to push for change to make the Bundeswehr a more capable force. In a somewhat bizarre step, the army itself has even launched a reality show \u2013 Die Rekruten, or \u2018The Recruits\u2019 \u2013 in a bid to revive manpower. However, this merely served to uncover a whole new set of problems. German soldiers, with their reputation of being disciplined, reliable and well-trained fighters, have always been the strongest part of the nation\u2019s armed forces down the years. Today, this image has been tarnished by a series of high-profile scandals, ranging from professional soldiers being detained on pedophilia charges to the rising number of reported rapes and cases of sexual abuse in the Bundeswehr. Among other scandals, some deal with the controversial topic of Nazi sympathies among some soldiers. The Bundeswehr was officially created months before West Germany\u2019s entry into NATO in 1955, and was founded by former officers of the Third Reich. Hasso von Mannteufel, who came up with the name \u2018Bundeswehr\u2019, invaded the USSR as a tank battalion commander, while Adolf Heusinger, the first senior officer-in-command of the Bundeswehr, was one of the Wehrmacht\u2019s main strategists who planned the invasions of Poland, Norway and France. A concept of \u2018citizens in uniform\u2019 was introduced, and the defense chiefs officially stated in 1982 that the Wehrmacht \u2013 a name still notorious to many Russians and Europeans \u2013 does not serve as the \u201cfoundation of a tradition\u201d for the Bundeswehr. Yet this doesn\u2019t seem to have fully taken root. Last year, numerous Wehrmacht memorabilia and Nazi-era artefacts were discovered inside several barracks. These included posters glorifying Nazi soldiers, as well as distinctive German steel helmets and replicas of the Wehrmacht\u2019s standard issue weapons. The uncomfortable revelation prompted the military to launch a thorough probe, with Defense Minister von der Leyen saying: \u201cwe need a broad process in the military itself, that we must travel together, from recruits to generals, from instructors to the minister.\u201d The far-right row was preceded by another scandal that revolved around Franco Albrecht, a 28-year-old first lieutenant who was allegedly plotting a hate-motivated terrorist attack. Investigators alleged the officer had been living a double life for more than a year, serving in the army while receiving state benefits under a bogus identity as a supposed Syrian refugee. Posing as an asylum seeker-turned-terrorist, he reportedly planned to shift the blame for an attack onto migrants \u2013 a kind of a false-flag operation. However, investigators ultimately came to the conclusion that there was no acute danger. Later, German media added fuel to the row sweeping the Bundeswehr ranks after members of Germany's elite KSK special forces unit were accused of staging a controversial farewell party for an outgoing officer. The party featured what was described by some media as a sex worker invited as a \u201cprize\u201d for the KSK commander, some songs of by ultra-right rock band Sturmwehr, as well as Nazi gestures which the elite soldiers preferred to a standard, internationally adopted military salute. As outrage mounted, military leaders were forced to act. \u201cIf we want to modernize the 35-year-old set of the Bundeswehr\u2019s traditions, we must also address the issue of names given to [army] bases,\u201d von der Leyen said at the time. \u201cI think that the Bundeswehr must make it absolutely clear that it does not stand for the traditions of [Nazi Germany\u2019s] Wehrmacht,\u201d she said. Among the measures proposed was a push to rename German bases bearing the names of Nazi soldiers, including the 9th Armored Training Brigade\u2019s base, which carries the name of Adelbert Schulz, one of Hitler\u2019s generals, who participated in the 1940 invasion of Belgium and then fought the Soviet Army in Ukraine in 1944. Another facility, the air force\u2019s NCO school, was named after Hans-Joachim Marseille, a Luftwaffe pilot glorified by Nazi propaganda as the \u2018Star of Africa\u2019. Since the end of the Cold War, the Bundeswehr has taken part in numerous conflicts around the world. Afghanistan, Mali and Iraq \u2013 where the Germans train Kurdish militias \u2013 are on the list of current deployments, but the government in Berlin is signaling there could be more. \u201cA quarter century of contraction is over. It is time for the Bundeswehr to grow again,\u201d von der Leyen announced in 2016. The German military is expected to develop qualitatively and quantitatively, with more troops being sent abroad as part of multinational operations. Experts say, however, that the ambitious strategy runs counter to with Germany\u2019s own laws. \u201cAs long as the Bundeswehr isn\u2019t operating strictly according to the UN Charter, the Federal Government violates the use of the Bundeswehr contrary to its own Constitution and the Soldiers\u2019 Act,\u201d Willy Wimmer, a former state secretary to the German defense minister, told RT. The Basic Law says Berlin has no right \u201cto participate in a war of aggression,\u201d Wimmer argued, with the 1999 Yugoslavia War and other operations clearly appearing to violate this provision. \u201cUnder the constitution, Germany has to contribute to [ensuring] peace in the world. This doesn\u2019t come by participating in wars of aggression and / or disregard of the UN Charter,\u201d he said. These broader questions on the Bundeswehr\u2019s role, coupled with the steady stream of news on its deficiencies, leaves Germany\u2019s military officials and politicians with much to think about.

Following five Syrian families who were granted asylum and subsequently spread across\u00a0the country, Danish researcher Ditte Shapiro arrived at\u00a0the conclusion that living in\u00a0smaller townships across\u00a0the country made it more difficult for\u00a0the newcomers to\u00a0adapt to\u00a0the Danish way of\u00a0life. \"I saw that families at\u00a0the asylum centers constantly met new people. They were received by\u00a0other Syrian families, leading to\u00a0both parents and children making new friends,\" Ditte Shapiro, the researcher behind\u00a0the study, told the Danish science portal Videnskab. According to\u00a0Shapiro, the departure of\u00a0a neighbor with\u00a0who a refugee has developed a helping and supporting relationship suddenly \"disappears\" after\u00a0being moved to\u00a0another accommodation. Moving immigrant families to\u00a0smaller communities was also found to\u00a0have an impeding effect on\u00a0their daily lifestyle due to\u00a0a lack of\u00a0contacts and the necessity of\u00a0having to\u00a0build new a new network from\u00a0scratch. Lastly, living in\u00a0a community, where no one has the same background or speaks the same language encumbered contact with\u00a0locals, spurring a feeling of\u00a0isolation.  \"When children and parents don't have a network in\u00a0the new local communities, the family core can be a vulnerable arrangement for\u00a0family life,\" Shapiro argued. Shapiro's findings contradict the current Danish policy of\u00a0dispersing immigrants equally to\u00a0all municipalities in\u00a0the country, in\u00a0accordance with\u00a0the so-called \"Spreading law\" from\u00a01999. According to\u00a0the law, the migrants are to\u00a0spend at\u00a0least three years in\u00a0the assigned municipality\u00a0\u2014 or risk forfeiting all of\u00a0the social benefits provided by\u00a0the state. The idea of\u00a0this praxis is to\u00a0improve integration and prevent the newcomers from\u00a0settling in\u00a0migrant-heavy areas, commonly referred to\u00a0as 'ghettos.'

The 47-year-old Finnish woman met the Iraqi asylum seeker, who was then 17 years old, near\u00a0Helsinki Railway Station in\u00a0November 2015. The man allegedly got lost and asked for\u00a0directions. The woman and the man exchanged phone numbers and began to\u00a0keep in\u00a0touch. In the beginning, contact was difficult and discussions were made using a largely improvised sign language and rudimentary English. Later, the man learned a lot of\u00a0words and became increasingly proficient in\u00a0Finnish. Over time, the woman and the man became friends and began to\u00a0spend more time together. Although the man never moved into\u00a0the woman's place, as\u00a0the landlord would not accept it, the woman regarded him as\u00a0a close person and eventually developed a deep and lasting bond, describing it as\u00a0a mother-son relationship.  Vantaa District Court, which considered the adult adoption, considered that the case was unfounded. In order for\u00a0an adult to\u00a0be able to\u00a0adopt another adult person, they should have an established long-term relationship that arose when the adoptee was still a child, which clearly isn't the case here. Consequently, the district court considered that the relationship between\u00a0the Finnish women and her Iraqi fosterling did not meet the requirement. After the man appealed the verdict by\u00a0the district court, the Helsinki Court of\u00a0Appeals found no reason for\u00a0a new hearing. The woman chose not to\u00a0appeal.

She wore black leggings and a pink fleece with a fluffy pink hood, her wispy blond hair tied in a loose ponytail. She did not especially want to be here. A flu last week had left her tired. A night of science homework lay ahead. On nights like this she wishes things were simpler. She wishes she could be just another girl instead of the girl she is, the famous one, the girl whose YouTube video got 9.3 million hits, the girl whom a British newspaper calls the youngest transgender activist in the world. \u201cDo you get tired talking about this sometimes?\u201d said Rebekah\u2019s mother, Jamie Bruesehoff, 36. \u201cYeah,\u201d Rebekah said. \u201cIt can get hard talking about when I wasn\u2019t myself. Other times I just want to be a normal kid. I just want to go to school. I have to do all that\u00a0homework.\u201d This Friday, the state of New Jersey began to do its part to help Rebekah be the person she is and always was. That\u2019s when the state Department of Health began posting a form on its website allowing transgender, non-binary and intersex people to change their birth certificates from the gender they were assigned at birth to the gender they live. The move comes as the result of a law signed in June by Gov. Phil Murphy. It is named the \u201cBabs Siperstein Law\u201d for the transgender advocate who pushed for it, and who in 2009 became the first openly transgender member of the Democratic National Committee. The law previously passed the legislature twice, but\u00a0\u00a0then-Gov. Chris Christie vetoed\u00a0 it both times. This time, Rebekah Bruesehoff joined other transgender people to lobby for the bill. \u201cShe probably was the most impactful\u201d person to testify on the issue, said Aaron Potenza, a spokesman for Garden State Equality, which advocates for the state\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. \u201cShe is so young, and she was able to speak from the heart. She\u2019s really, really smart. And she\u2019s adorable too.\u201d Rebekah, whose life as a girl belies her male genitalia, will change the gender on her birth certificate from \u201cM\u201d to \"F.\u201d Nonbinary people, whose gender is neither exclusively female nor male, and intersex people, whose bodies do not fit traditional gender definitions, will be able to mark \u201cX.\u201d More: LGBT students in NJ feel harassed, survey finds More: Boy Scouts to pay $18,000, apologize to 9-year-old transgender boy thrown out of pack In the past, people hoping to change the gender on their birth certificates were required to obtain a letter from a therapist attesting to the fact that they experience gender dysphoria, historically defined as the distress arising when a person\u2019s gender assigned at birth does not match that individual\u2019s gender identity. They also were required to produce proof of surgery to change their anatomy. But what intelligent society requires people who know who they are to prove it with surgery? \u201cKids aren\u2019t getting surgery. That\u2019s not a thing,\u201d Jamie Bruesehoff said. \u201cShe may never have surgery. That\u2019s entirely up to her, and that\u2019s an adult decision we\u2019re not going to think about now.\u201d Besides, being transgender doesn\u2019t necessarily cause a person distress. What causes distress is a transgender person trying to live a happy life surrounded by people who bully them, discriminate against them or, in the worst possible cases, murder them. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t a very safe place for trans people,\u201d Bruesehoff said. Rebekah Bruesehoff became an internationally famous transgender activist by accident. It was 2017, and Rebekah and her mother traveled from their home in Vernon, Sussex County, to Jersey City to protest the Trump administration\u2019s decision to rescind rules protecting transgender youth in schools. About 200 people attended the protest, Jamie said. She took pictures of Rebekah holding a sign, which read, \u201cI\u2019m the SCARY transgender person the MEDIA warned you about.\u201d Rebekah was looking extra cute, with a big smile and her blond hair dyed purple. Jamie posted the photos to social media thinking a few people, mostly family members and friends, might see them. Millions of people saw the pictures. Activists in the LGBT community reposted them, seeing in Rebekah a symbol that their movement is kind, friendly and beyond rebuke. \u201cI love Rebekah Bruesehoff so much!!\u201d a woman identified as Jenna from Pennsylvania said on Twitter. \u201cShe is so inspiring!\u201d People who oppose rights for transgender people saw the pictures too, and were frightened by them. One conservative person who posts on Twitter under the handle \u201cChurch of Britain\u201d wrote that \u201cJust because my father dresses me in female clothing dies (sic) not mean I consent to permanent irreversible mutilation if (sic) my genitalia.\u201d The post is incorrect in two respects. The decision to dress as a girl is entirely Rebekah\u2019s, she and her parents said; and she has not yet considered any surgery. Mean Tweets were the least of the family\u2019s problems. Some people contacted the Bruesehoffs to issue death threats against the entire family, Jamie said. Someone called the state's child welfare agency to allege that Jamie and her husband Christopher, a pastor at a local Lutheran church in Vernon, were giving Rebekah hormones and forcing their son to be a girl. The accusation was ludicrous,\u00a0\u00a0the family said. Regardless, workers with the Child Protection and Permanency\u00a0agency were required to visit the home. \u201cIt was really scary,\u201d Jamie Bruesehoff said. \u201cNobody wants someone knocking at your door trying to decide if you\u2019re abusing your kid or not.\u201d This is the kind of treatment that makes psychologists and social scientists worry. More than 41 percent of transgender adults have attempted suicide, a rate nine times higher than the national average, according to the American Institute for Suicide Prevention. But trans children who receive support from their families and friends can buck the trend. For example, transgender children who can live openly as transgendered by using their chosen names experience 71 percent fewer symptoms of severe depression, and report 65 percent fewer thoughts of suicide, according to research published last year by Stephen Russell, chair of the human development and family sciences department at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cBefore I transitioned I couldn\u2019t be myself. It didn\u2019t feel right. I felt lost,\u201d said Rebekah, who publicly transitioned from being a boy to a girl at age 8. \u201cWhen I transitioned I learned that others didn\u2019t have all the supportive family members and school that I had.\u201d The life of a famous pre-teen activist isn\u2019t always so difficult. Last summer Rebekah gave a speech to 31,000 people inside NRG Stadium in Houston for a youth gathering by the Evangelical Lutheran Church. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew they would be very supportive no matter if I messed up.\u201d Likewise, the momentous event of changing Rebekah\u2019s birth certificate will be no big deal. On Friday morning, Jamie planned to search the state health department\u2019s website for the required form. She will pay $6. She will print it, fill it out, and place it in an envelope.

And, yet, EU\u2019s policy on Iran, assuming such a thing exists, is plagued by contradictions. The EU\u2019s spokesperson for foreign policy, Ms. Federica Mogherini has devoted most of her immense energies operating as a lobbyist for the Islamic Republic. She has visited more than 30 countries to present the Islamic Republic as the poor little lamb facing the American big bad wolf. To show what a special place the mullahs have in her heart, when in Tehran, she wears the full Khomeinist hijab, but when she visits other Islamic capitals she unleashes her peroxide blonde hair in full evidence. In private, EU officials dismiss that as childish symbolism. The problem is that symbolism does matter as much in politics as in poetics. For example, when, just weeks after leaving office, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel heads a delegation of European businessmen to Tehran and praises the Islamic Republic as a rock of stability in the Mideast, some in the Khomeinist leadership will see that as an endorsement of Tehran\u2019s reckless adventurism. For almost two years the EU has fostered the illusion in the Islamic Republic that it can continue doing as it pleases without risking any bad consequence. When the Trump administration unveiled a series of measures to force Tehran to modify aspects of its behavior, the EU rejected the American position but followed all the sanctions that Washington imposed on Iran. At the same time, however, the EU appointed a team to find ways of circumventing those same sanctions. This duality, not to say duplicity, led to the idea of creating an \u201calternative system of trade financial transactions\u201d to help the Islamic Republic sell its oil to Europe and buy European goods and services. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas promises Tehran it would be\u201d accommodated\u201d in the global trading system. The idea that the Islamic Republic merits special favorable treatment was invented by former US President Barack Obama. He created a parallel UN Security Council in the shape of the so-called 5+1 group of powers. The idea was to allow Tehran to ignore six UNSC resolutions that it did not like. Obama also ignored the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by exempting Iran from its terms and conjuring the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (CJPOA) which clearly states it is tailor-made only for Iran. The EU\u2019s special favorable treatment of the Islamic Republic includes keeping mum about over 20 EU citizens currently held as hostages in Tehran. It is also indicated by the mere rap-on-the wrist response of the Europeans to the Islamic Republic\u2019s latest terrorist operations in four European countries. Ironically, a more credible exposure of the destructive role that the Islamic Republic plays in Europe has come from Tehran\u2019s former Ambassador in Berlin Ali Majedi. Majedi is no defector or dissident. He is back in Tehran at the end of his Berlin mission, starting his retirement. However, he told reporters in Tehran that he had seen that the Europeans had \u201cextensive evidence\u201d about Iran\u2019s \u201cdestructive activities\u201d which could not be attributed to \u201cundisciplined elements\u201d in Tehran. Europeans, including British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, delude themselves in believing that by \u201cworking with Iran\u201d they could prevent the Islamic Republic from \u201ccrossing the red lines.\u201d The problem is that the Islamic Republic does not cross those real or imaginary \u201cred lines\u201d. Like the now-defunct Soviet Union in its time, the Islamic Republic\u2019s strategy is to cross only \u201cpink lines\u201d, which constitute 99 percent of the norms of international behavior, whenever possible. The Islamic Republic has no troops in Yemen but manages to keep that tragedy going by helping Houthi rebels hang on to the patch of territory they hold. The last of Iranian military advisers have left Iraq. But they have left behind thousands of Iraqi military who lived in Iran for decades and hold dual nationality to lead pro-Tehran militias. Tehran sets the tune in Beirut not through Iranian troops but by hiring local manpower from all communities, notably the Hezbollah. Of the estimated 80,000 troops that Tehran has in Syria, less than 10 percent are Iranians, others being mercenaries from a dozen countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria itself.  The Islamic Republic has crossed no red-line in Afghanistan but it hires thousands of armed men from all communities, most recently from among the Taliban as well. In the EU countries, Tehran is careful not to cross \u201cred lines\u201d. But, it crosses \u201dpink lines\u201d when it can through mosques, hussainiyahs, religious endowments and fake charities. In Britain alone, the Islamic Republic controls at least a dozen tax-exempt \u201ccharities\u201d, often used for financing violent groups across the globe or simply for money laundering. Part of the EU\u2019s soft spot for the Islamic Republic may be inspired by endemic anti-Americanism which is present in most European political circles, left and right. We saw one example of this latent anti-Americanism last week over the crisis in Venezuela. When members of the Organization of American States (OAS) almost unanimously rejected Nicolas Maduro\u2019s claim to the presidency and endorsed Juan Guaido as Interim President of Venezuela, EU officials and media tried to portray this as another example of the US throwing its weight around. Thus, they began by saying they won\u2019t follow that policy. Once they realized that the anti-Maduro front covered virtually the whole of the Americas and was not another instance of \u201cbullying by Trump\u201d they used duplicity to cover their mistake. They gave Maduro eight days to organize new presidential elections or risk seeing the EU back Guaido\u2019s claim as the OAS, including the US, had done. It was obvious that Maduro won\u2019t accept what would amount to admitting the legitimacy of his presidency. It was obvious that no election could be organized in eight days. It was also obvious that even if an election were held by an illegitimate regime it would have no legitimacy. Anti-American demagoguery had produced a laughable policy. On Venezuela as on the Islamic Republic in Iran, the European Union must remove its anti-US, nowadays presented as only anti-Trump, glasses to see reality.

Her husband, an accomplice, was sentenced to 40 days in jail and ordered to pay $4,018 in fines, according to the Salinas Californian. In addition, they must donate $10,000 to the state\u2019s fund to fight succulent thieves. It is the fourth successful prosecution of plant heists in the Golden State\u2019s wild landscapes, with more investigations underway,\u00a0according to warden Patrick Freeling of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. It\u2019s illegal to remove any plant from state or national parks. Since the arrests volunteers have worked to return thousands of confiscated plants to their wild and windswept Northern California coastal cliffs. But authorities fear that many more crimes have gone undetected. The kidnapped plants \u2014 small and squat blue-green blobs, with rosettes of fleshy leaves tipped in vermilion \u2014 lack the elegance of\u00a0California\u2019s other commonly poached species, such as salmon, bear and elk. It has a moment of beauty when it blooms, erecting a tall stem and a candelabra-like cluster of yellow flowers. Named after William Russell Dudley, the first head of Stanford\u2019s botany department, the plant is adapted to our coast\u2019s cliffs. But all too often, it\u2019s ending up in kitchens and living rooms far overseas. Investigators\u00a0suspect that organized smuggling rings are behind the purloined plants, which\u00a0sell from $40 to $1,000 on Asia\u2019s black market. Millions of people ascending to middle class status and incomes can now afford decorative plant arrangements, is fueling demand. Davis was on a scenic drive with her family to Big Sur when they pulled over onto a Highway 1 turnout at the state park to rescue a toy that her son had dropped in the back seat of the car. They decided to wait a few minutes and eat. \u201cIt was such a coincidental encounter,\u201d Davis recalled. \u201cWe saw the two people coming up off the trailhead. They had several large heavy bags so we waited and watched. They began transferring items from the bags to the car and it only took a minute or two to catch a glimpse of the Dudleyas.\u201d \u201cI got out of the car and approached them, taking a photo of their license plate and the bags,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI asked them if they knew that stealing native plants in a state park is illegal and they both smiled and did not seem concerned.\u201d The bags contained 1,872 flowers of the plant. \u201cI just realize I did something wrong, because I don\u2019t know anything about relevant laws and that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Guanrong Rivera told Judge\u00a0Rafael\u00a0Vazquez\u00a0through a Mandarin interpreter. The global plant smuggling scheme was first revealed by an anonymous phone call to CDFW\u2019s Freeling over the December 2017 holidays. The caller, frustrated at being stuck in a long line while trying to mail a Christmas gift at Mendocino\u2019s tiny post office, was suspicious. A\u00a0man in line ahead of her was shipping 60 packages to China. As the line snaked out the door, she asked what was in the boxes. \u201cThe man put his finger up to his lip and said, \u2018Shhhh, something very valuable,\u2019 \u201d said Freeling. \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d she asked. The man pointed toward the ocean. Alerted by Freeling, U.S. Customs and Border Protection X-rayed the packages\u00a0\u2014 and discovered Dudleya. Other investigations\u00a0followed. In January 2018, Xiao Yang of Roseville was caught at a Caltrans easement in Point Arena with 50 plants. He was fined $5,000, given 3 years probation and ordered to participate in 240 hours of community service. In March, Koreans Hyeongjae Kim and Minguk Cho flew into San Francisco, rented a minivan and drove to Point Arena on the Mendocino Coast, where they were caught stealing 850 plants. They were fined $10,333 each and denied re-entry into the United States without state or federal approval. A trio of foreign poachers \u2014 Liu Fengxia of China and Tae-Hun Kim and Tae-Hyun Kim of Korea \u2013 were caught, also in March, with 2,148 plants in the Humboldt County town of Trinidad. They were fined $10,000 each, forfeited $10,200 in seized cash and also denied re-entry into the United States without authorization. They had fraudulently written \u201cclothing\u201d on the postal service custom forms of boxes holding Dudleya \u2013 a felony. Charges are still pending for multiple suspects who stole plants from Point Reyes National Seashore and coastal Mendocino County. Those alleged smugglers traveled north from Los Angeles, according to Freeling. The suspects operated at night, rappelling over cliffs to get thousands of plants, then returned to Southern California.Related Articles\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tSan Jose: Man arrested in fatal restaurant stabbing\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tLAPD looking into legality of taped city council remarks\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tSan Jose transgender activist, teacher was vengeful \u2018enforcer\u2019 for all-female biker gang, leading to Oakland triple homicide, DA says\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tSt. Louis school gunman had 600 rounds, AR-15-style weapon\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tCondition of Texas teen shot eating hamburger \u2018touch and go\u2019 \u201cI\u00a0hope that everyone learns from this, from poachers to individuals that think that they can\u2019t do anything to help,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAwareness is so important.\u201d We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

In decades past, the well-worn path to the White House involved holding a number of political positions. Of the previous 12 postwar presidents, only Dwight Eisenhower was a non-politician \u2014 and he was the general who led the Allied effort in World War II. But since Donald Trump upset that apple cart in his unlikely run to the Republican nomination and the White House, it seems that everyone else who\u2019s succeeded in running a large corporation wants to follow his lead. This phenomenon really began with H. Ross Perot in 1992, and while Perot\u2019s independent campaign that year only drew about 19% of the vote \u2014 and likely split the GOP enough to allow Bill Clinton to win with a 43% plurality \u2014 Perot\u2019s two campaigns inspired other business leaders to try their own runs. (Perot\u2019s second attempt in 1996 gave birth to the Reform Party, which four years later was the vehicle for Trump\u2019s first, short-lived attempt at the White House.) In 2012, businessman Herman Cain led the GOP field for a short time before rumors of an extramarital affair drove him from the race, and four years later Trump was joined in the fray for a time by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Yet no business leader has tried to enter the presidential race from the left side of political center. Sure, Michael Bloomberg has hinted at it, as has billionaire Tom Steyer from the far left, but their whispering campaigns didn\u2019t produce a fraction of the angst that\u2019s greeted Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz recently. As The Wall Street Journal editorial board opined, \u201cDemocrats have since been shrieking like teenagers at a horror movie\u201d at the prospect of a Schultz run. So why are they afraid of a businessman with low name ID jumping into a presidential race sure to have larger-than-life personalities on both major-party tickets? Because he might cost them some precious votes. The former Starbucks CEO has long been a loyal Democrat, but he has a problem that\u2019s summed up well by National Review\u2019s Kevin Williamson: \u201cSchultz \u2026 is on cultural issues where the Democrats are, but he is not culturally where they are, which at the moment is somewhere in the leafy suburbs of Pyongyang.\u201d Schultz is also a straight, white, wealthy male at a time when the \u201cprogressives\u201d are looking for a candidate to check as many \u201cvictim\u201d boxes as possible. (Thus far, though, we haven\u2019t seen the Democrats\u2019 ultimate candidate, which would be a transgender person of color.) So the very idea of Schultz taking his shot is \u201creckless idiocy\u201d that merits a heckler screaming \u201cdon\u2019t help elect Trump!\u201d But PJ Media\u2019s Roger Simon makes the case that there\u2019s room in the center for a candidate who understands the economic idiocy of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and free college but wouldn\u2019t be as hard-line on immigration as Trump, nor would he be at war with the media. While the Fourth Estate wouldn\u2019t be ecstatic about his bid, they may treat Schultz as the adult in the room when compared to Trump. Let\u2019s put it this way: Schultz knows he\u2019d be ground to bits in a Democrat primary race that\u2019s sure to be a contest of who can race farthest left, so why not spend a little money for ballot access to make an independent run and see if America really is a center-left country? If, as they say, the youth of the nation are pining for utopian socialism, the vote split would come from Trump\u2019s side, right? Could it be that leftists know we\u2019re onto their game, leaving Democrats no choice but to try to clear the field? Look for the Leftmedia to dutifully dig up enough dirt on Schultz to dissuade him from running at all.

It\u2019s also home to one of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing communities of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who make up one percent of the local population just four years after the first families moved from London. A whopping 72 percent of Canvey Island\u2019s constituency of Castle Point voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum \u2014 21 points above the national result and the third most pro-Brexit of the United Kingdom\u2019s 650 constituencies. Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s anguished pullout from the European Union, is becoming reality this week. It has toppled two cabinets before its achievement became the core policy of the Conservative Party\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson. Brexit\u2019s proponents say it will restore British sovereignty from the EU, which they perceive as increasingly encroaching on domestic issues. Opponents say it is both rooted in and amplifying xenophobia, as well as financially hazardous. Wherever the truth lies, a pro-Brexit bastion like Canvey Island hardly seems like the most intuitive place for ultra-Orthodox Jews to settle down. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Joel Friedman, a 33-year-old father of seven from London, and a handful of his friends did in 2016, when they planted the seed for what has rapidly grown into a community of 76 families who could not afford the housing prices in nearby London. When Friedman presented his plan to members of his community in the heavily ultra-Orthodox London neighborhood of Stamford Hill, the reactions he encountered ranged from dismissiveness to shock, he told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \u201cSome people told us, \u2018Don\u2019t go there, they\u2019re all racists there, they\u2019re all for Brexit,\u2019\u201d he recalled. (Friedman added he believed that ultra-Orthodox Jews who care about Brexit are as split on the issue as other involved members of the general population.) Despite some minor incidents involving anti-Semitism, walking around Canvey Island \u2013 it\u2019s not an island at all \u2014 while wearing the clothes of ultra-Orthodox Jews is \u201cabsolutely safe,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cWe have excellent neighborly relations.\u201d Tony Eaton, who lives next door to several Jewish families, generally concurred \u2014 phrasing it with British understatement. \u201cThey\u2019re not worse than anyone else you might want as your neighbor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep to themselves, mind their own business, and so do we, really,\u201d added Eaton, who voted for the Conservatives and supported getting Brexit done. Anti-Semitic incidents were due to young quarrelsome men, often drunk, rather than any organized ideological group or opposition to Jewish presence, several members of the local Jewish community said in interviews with JTA. Eaton is one of many white, English baby boomers who moved sometime after the 1970s from London to Essex, the county to which Canvey Island belongs. Just like the ultra-Orthodox, the baby boomers came to improve their quality of life and for affordable housing. But many of them also were eager to leave behind the increasingly multicultural metropolis of London, which began seeing an influx of immigrants from Asia, Africa and other parts of Europe about 50 years ago. The so-called white flight to Canvey Island may explain why the center-right Conservative Party has won here in all but one election since 1983. As in the United States, ultra-Orthodox Jews in the United Kingdom seem to vote overwhelmingly for right-wing parties, and Canvey Island\u2019s political orientation has helped its new arrivals feel at home. \u201cWe\u2019re conservative, they\u2019re conservative,\u201d Jacob Gross, a father of six who is in charge of security for Canvey Island\u2019s Jewish community, said of the town\u2019s Jewish and non-Jewish contingents. \u201cDespite our differences, there\u2019s a worldview that we share.\u201d Politics, though, were not what brought the Jews to Canvey Island, which has about 40,000 residents and 16,000 houses. Back in northern London, which is about an hour\u2019s drive from Canvey Island, Friedman was living in a rented home with three bedrooms worth well over a million pounds, or $1.3 million \u2013 a sum that is wholly unaffordable to most ultra-Orthodox families and double what such a property costs in Canvey Island. \u201cEven those who do have the money can\u2019t buy a house there because there\u2019s such a shortage,\u201d said Gross, who supports Brexit even though it caused his outdoor toy business to tank. Uncertainty around Brexit caused the British pound to weaken against the dollar, hurting his profits, he said. \u201cBut Brexit is still the right thing to do for this country,\u201d he said. Friedman and Gross were members of a group of activists who decided to band together and establish a new community in a more affordable market that is still near London. This overflow from Stamford Hill reflects a major demographic development in British Jewry. The ultra-Orthodox are projected to become that minority\u2019s largest group by 2031, according to a 2015 report by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. That year, ultra-Orthodox births accounted for 47 percent of all Jewish births. The non-ultra-Orthodox Jewish birthrate in the United Kingdom is 1.98 children per woman, only slightly above the national average, according to the report. Ultra-Orthodox Jews typically have at least four children and a much smaller rate of assimilation. The beating heart of the Jewish community of Canvey Island is the yeshiva, the local name for a Jewish community center built inside a former school. The yeshiva is located about a mile north of the city center, with its suburban strip mall and shoulderless, patchy roads whose sidewalks are often cluttered with merchandise belonging to the area\u2019s many small construction firms and body shops. The community center has a kosher convenience store, a synagogue and an event hall that is by far the prettiest space in the otherwise decaying building. There are also classrooms for the community\u2019s approximately 350 children. On Shabbat afternoon, many ultra-Orthodox children play on the quiet streets bordering the yeshiva. Officially, the children are all home-schooled. Canvey Island does not have a Jewish school, an amenity whose establishment would require considerable red tape and government oversight. Several ultra-Orthodox schools are facing closure for their alleged failure to teach sex education, evolution and other core requirements. In practice, the yeshiva compound functions as a gender-segregated school, although the classes are called clubs. The place also has a mikvah, a ritual bath. Canvey Island, however, does not have a rabbi. The community is still looking for a suitable candidate, Gross said. Last month, a fire damaged part of the yeshiva center: One of the students forgot to extinguish the Hanukkah menorah. The blaze was extinguished quickly and caused minor damage to the center, Friedman said. The Jewish Community of Canvey Island, a registered charity that represents the Jewish population, arranged for swimming lessons at a nearby pool. Different time slots were set aside for boys and girls, Friedman noted. \u201cLife is great for the children here,\u201d said an ultra-Orthodox resident who moved to Canvey Island and identified himself only as Shaul. \u201cThey can play outside, leave their bikes unlocked. It\u2019s a totally different world to London.\u201d Shaul, his wife and five children moved from Stamford Hill three years ago. They were living in a two-room apartment, he said. \u201cI just love the sea breeze,\u201d he said on a sunny afternoon last month. To be sure, Canvey Island is one of several locales in the United Kingdom where ultra-Orthodox communities from London have settled in recent years in search of affordable housing. There\u2019s Manchester, situated 180 miles north of London, and Gateshead, an ultra-Orthodox town of 8,000 residents located a further 100 miles northward. But in the London area, Canvey Island is one of a kind. \u201cPeople can still work there and live here,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThey can still remain part of family life in Stamford Hill.\u201d His community operates four daily shuttle buses to northern London. With more Jews expressing an interest in moving to Canvey Island, the local Jewish community has taken precautions to avoid this trend of driving up market prices, Gross said. \u201cThere\u2019s a committee. There\u2019s a strict limit on how much we allow newcomers to bid,\u201d Gross said. Supply is rooted in local baby boomers reaching retirement age and selling assets in Canvey Island to buy smaller apartments now that their children have moved out, Friedman explained. \u201cIt means there is availability,\u201d he said, \u201cand room to grow.\u201d Do you rely on The Times of Israel for accurate and insightful news on Israel and the Jewish world?

The 25-year-old Senegal international has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal after completing a medical and agreeing personal terms, having arrived at the club's Finch Farm training ground earlier in the day. \"It's a great day for me, a big dream to play in the Premier League and a big dream to play for Everton,\" he told evertontv. \"Everton is one of the best teams in the Premier League and the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world. \"I know Everton is one of the big clubs here in England with history, the fans and the great players, so I'm very excited and happy to be here. \"I started to watch Everton more since the beginning of October because I had heard about their interest. \"I was interested to see how they play and how they have good young players. If you see players who are aged 20 or 21 and see them perform like that, you know you have a good coach. \"The manager has said exactly what he wants. He believes I can be a player who can add something to the team.\" Niasse, the Russian Premier League's player of the year in 2015, has scored 13 goals in 23 appearances this season and, as he can play across the front three, he comes in as a replacement for Steven Naismith, who was sold to Norwich for \u00a38.5million earlier in the window. He becomes the club's third most expensive signing after Romelu Lukaku (\u00a328million) and Marouane Fellaini (\u00a315million) and is expected to have the necessary visa clearance in order to be eligible for this weekend's Barclays Premier League match at Stoke. Niasse will be presented to fans at the Toffees' home game against Newcastle on Wednesday. \"We're delighted because Oumar is a player we have been following for a long time,\" said manager Roberto Martinez. \"He is the right personality and someone who is in a very good moment of his career. He has had a lot of success in Russia and he brings a different quality to what we already have in our squad. \"I'm really pleased to be able to bring in Oumar in this window and we know he's going to have a massive impact going forward. \"He brings a real hunger and desire to be successful into what is already a strong squad.\" Earlier in the day Everton loaned winger Aiden McGeady to Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday but fellow Republic of Ireland international Darron Gibson opted to stay at Goodison Park despite Martinez previously suggesting the player would benefit from a loan to get some much-needed pitch time ahead of this summer's Euro 2016. Everton's 23-year-old reserve-team forward Conor McAleny has joined League One side Wigan on loan until the end of the season as Niasse's arrival lessens his chances of making the match-day squad. Despite Niasse not playing a competitive fixture since December 10 due to Russia's winter break, Martinez believes he will not need long to make an impact. \"He'll need a little bit of time to understand the Premier League, with the tempo and all the new aspects of the league,\" the Toffees boss said. \"But I wouldn't expect too long because he is the type of player who can have an impact in any game. \"He's got a really good physicality - he is very strong and powerful - and it's not just scoring goals, he penetrates and opens up teams in the final third which allows others to benefit from his work as well. \"He is a strong, powerful striker who can play in different positions. He is going to be a terrific, fresh addition to a squad that will welcome his ability. \"We moved a couple of players on and the freshness Oumar Niasse brings is going to be very positive going forward.\"", "hero": "Oumar Niasse", "victim": "None", "villain": "None", "partisanship": "Center", "year": "2016", "model_hero": "<pad> Everton's support for a long time and we are delighted to have him here.\"</s>", "model_hero_score": 0.32218292355537415, "prompt_length_exceeded": true, "model_villain": "<pad> Senegal citizenship for a long time and he has a great personality.</s>", "model_villain_score": 0.3154520094394684, "model_victim": "<pad> Senegal citizenship for a long time and he has a great personality.</s>", "model_victim_score": 0.3253614604473114, "duration": {"hero": 3.395486354827881, "villain": 3.098865270614624, "victim": 3.1006758213043213}}, {"article_id": "420471189", "publication_date": "2016-02-01 02:54:21", "headline": "News24.com | Egypt attacks in Sinai leave 4 security forces dead", "url": "http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/egypt-attacks-in-sinai-leave-4-security-forces-dead-20160201", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "False", "themes": "politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,terrorism,bombs and explosives", "media_id": "39458", "media_name": "news24", "media_url": "http://www.news24.com/", "origin_country": "Unknown", "article_text": "Monday, 15 May 01 Feb 2016 Cairo - Two Egyptian policemen and two soldiers were killed on Sunday in two bombing attacks in the country's restive Sinai Peninsula, where ISIS jihadists have regularly attacked security forces. In one attack at dawn, a remotely-detonated bomb hit a police vehicle as security forces were carrying out a search operation in the Rafah region, on the border with the Gaza Strip, killing two policemen, officials said. An army officer and a soldier were also killed in a similar attack in the Sheikh Zuwaid region of northern Sinai, the officials added. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the region is an ISIS stronghold. Jihadists have regularly attacked security forces in the peninsula since the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. They say their attacks are in retaliation for a government crackdown targeting Morsi supporters that has left hundreds dead and thousands imprisoned. The authorities say hundreds of policemen and soldiers have been killed in attacks, mainly in North Sinai, since 2013. Egypt's branch of ISIS also said it planted a bomb that caused the crash of a Russian airliner in the Sinai in October, killing all 224 people on board. Can you ace them all?

Saeed was arrested on Monday and put under house arrest, fuelling speculation in the country as to why did the authorities crossed the Rubicon to lay hands on the powerful jihadist leader and mastermind of Mumbai terror attacks. Watch What Else is Making News Dawn newspaper in its editorial said the move to arrest Saeed and four of his colleagues and place the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and the Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation (FiF) on further terror watch list will be \u201cclosely watched both inside Pakistan and abroad\u201d. \u201cThe arrests in Punjab, the statements attributed to federal officials and the supportive comments by Director General ISPR (Inter-services Public Relation) Gen (Major General) Asif Ghafoor indicate that the actions against Saeed and the organisations he leads have been taken after inter-institutional, federal-provincial discussions \u2014 increasing the likelihood that the clampdown will be sustained and meaningful,\u201d it opined. It said, clearly Pakistan cannot win the fight against militancy and extremism until it adopts a zero-tolerance approach against all manifestations of the problem. \u201cAnd, just as clearly, notwithstanding the protestations of innocence by the JuD/FiF/LeT and the angry denunciations by their cadres of the government\u2019s action, Saeed and his associates have a great deal to answer for,\u201d it said. The paper stressed that government should first properly launch firm legal case against Saeed and the organisations he leads, as the watch-listed JuD and FiF and the banned LeT have sophisticated legal operations that have often, and easily, been able to outmanoeuvre investigators and state prosecutors. It said the various groups in the LeT umbrella network will likely try and hide behind ostensibly legal activities such as charitable operations and social welfare services. \u201cBut if the strategic control of the various groups in the network and the financial linkages between them are unearthed and made public, the dismantling of the entire apparatus should become possible,\u201d it wrote. The paper also emphasised that the state must start to move against all militant and extremist networks in a methodical manner, doing so on a timeline that suggests an internal consensus and not external pressure. \u201cAlready the JuD/FiF, like-minded groups and a sprawling national network of supporters have tried to cast the crackdown as an external agenda, of a government and state cravenly submitting to the diktat of outside powers, especially the US,\u201d it said. But, a sweeping set of actions against all groups and emphatic public ownership of those actions by the military and political leadership would send a strong signal. \u201cThe fight against militancy is a fight for Pakistan by Pakistan for Pakistani reasons \u2014 that is the message that the state must send urgently,\u201d it concluded.

Firmly believes that there's nothing more important in a democracy than a well-informed electorate. Akkai Padmashali is one of the most prominent activists in India. She recently got married to Mr. Vasu, her friend of eight years and fellow activist, breaking stereotypes and barriers, and increasing the acceptance of the transgender community by society. \u201cMarriage was an unexpected event in my life. I was always uncertain about it. What with my apprehensions about domestic violence and other atrocities, I had a suspicious notion about marriage. But my friends convinced me that marriage had another side too. I am experimenting in my marriage life. I will, of course, continue to strongly fight for people who experience domestic violence \u2013 including myself.\u201d A look at her life Akkai Padmashali was born on 31 May 1983 in Bangalore to a middle-class, conservative family. Akkai\u2019s father was in the Air Force, and her mother was a homemaker. Born a boy, Akkai lived a confused childhood. She struggled to identify as a male, often wearing her sister\u2019s clothes, being comfortable around girls, and struggling to deal with her parents\u2019 ire. Her parents, frustrated by their son\u2019s behaviour, took Akkai to local doctors and traditional healers to \u201ccure\u201d her. At the age of 12, Akkai tried to kill herself, twice. Gradually, though, she learnt to live with herself. She began to embrace her female identity. When she revealed to her brother about her acceptance of a female identity, he was supportive. This encouraged her to confess to her parents as well. \u201cThere was initial non-acceptance,\u201d Akkai told The Logical Indian. \u201cBut, over time, they supported my identity and activism. I come from a rigid background with its patriarchal notions, but you need to struggle for yourself and speak out for others. My family grew supportive of me, even though I come from a working class, non-English-speaking background.\u201d Finding herself As a child, Akkai would see transgenders at the local park, begging for money from commuters. They would often be forced to resort to sex work to earn a living. Though Akkai resolved to make a life for herself with her new identity, she spent a few years in the same lifestyle. She had to resort to begging and offering herself to men at the same park. Over the years, she met many like her and conversed with people who were confused like her, exploited like her, and lost like her. Inspired to do something to help the millions of others suffering in silence, Akkai decided to work to help sexual minorities. She joined Sangama, a local NGO, and it was here that she realised that India\u2019s sexual minorities would never improve without change at the policymaking level. The crusade against Section 377 Akkai identified the root problem as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality. She said, \u201cSection 377 is colonial law. It is an immoral act which adversely affects the community and the right to privacy. Section 377 is an attack on democracy. It has to be repealed. The government has to play a sensitive role, one of responsible governance. Successive governments have not been supportive of LGBT rights; we are very disappointed with the State\u2019s attitude towards sexual minorities and gender issues. I strongly stand for what I say; Section 377 has to be deleted.\u201d One of the most vocal advocates for the rights of sexual minorities Akkai has been one of the most vocal advocates for the rights of sexual minorities in India. She was invited by the President to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Chief Justice of India. She has also addressed audiences from Bangalore to Tokyo on LGBT rights. After the Supreme Court had acknowledged \u2018transgender\u2019 as the third gender, Akkai was the first member of the transgender community to get a driver\u2019s licence. She is a founder-member of Ondede (\u2018convergence\u2019 in Kannada), an organisation that aims to create awareness about sexuality, sexual diversity, and sexual orientation. A fervent critic of India\u2019s stance on sexual rights, Akkai also acknowledges a gradual improvement of the same in the country. \u201cIf you compare India with other countries, we are relatively progressive. Here, we have the liberty to bring any issue to the table. If you compared the India today with India 20 years ago, it becomes obvious that we have come a long way when it comes to gender issues. This is especially so for the youth movement, especially in universities and private institutions where people are more progressive and open-minded.\u201d The Logical Indian thanks Akkai for all the wonderful work she has done to bring the voice of the sexual minorities to the fore. We also congratulate her on her wedding and wish the best for the new chapter of her journey. We are an independent and public-spirited digital media platform for Indian millennials. We report news and issues that matter as well as give you the opportunity to take action.", "hero": " Akkai Padmashali", "victim": " Akkai Padmashali, sexual minorities", "villain": "Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code", "partisanship": "Center", "year": "2017", "model_hero": "<pad> Akkai Padmashali</s>", "model_hero_score": 0.4766417145729065, "prompt_length_exceeded": true, "model_villain": "<pad> Mr. Vasu</s>", "model_villain_score": 0.42648428678512573, "model_victim": "<pad> Akkai Padmashali</s>", "model_victim_score": 0.47465696930885315, "duration": {"hero": 1.4847118854522705, "villain": 1.0396034717559814, "victim": 1.4852335453033447}}, {"article_id": "574878352", "publication_date": "2017-02-01 02:22:00", "headline": "Conservative Gorsuch emulates Scalia minus the rough edges", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20170201/news/302019963/", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "True", "themes": "politics and government,law and legislation,appointments and executive changes,biographical information,legal profession,judges", "media_id": "104", "media_name": "Daily Herald - Arlington Heights, IL", "media_url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/", "origin_country": "US", "article_text": "Judge Neil Gorsuch speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, after President Donald Trump announced Gorsuch as his nominee for the Supreme Court.\r\n\t\tAssociated Press Judge Neil Gorsuch stands with his wife Louise as President Donald Trump announces him as his choice for the Supreme Court during a televised event in the East Room on the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017.\r\n\t\tAssociated Press Judge Neil Gorsuch speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, after President Donald Trump announced Gorsuch as his nominee for the Supreme Court.\r\n\t\tAssociated Press WASHINGTON -- If confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch would fill the seat of the man he seeks to emulate as a judge. He would be the first justice to serve alongside a colleague for whom he worked. Gorsuch described his former boss, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Tuesday as one of the judges who brought him up in the law. President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died nearly a year ago. Trump said he was delivering on his pledge to choose someone in Scalia's mold. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver for the past 11 years, said he adheres to Scalia's approach to the law, evaluating the Constitution and laws by how they were understood when they written. He also shares with Scalia a flair for writing. But unlike the sometimes irascible Scalia, Gorsuch approaches his work with a courtly manner more reminiscent of Kennedy. Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the bipartisan National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, has known Gorsuch since they worked as clerks on the federal appeals court in Washington, though for different judges. \"His opinions stand out for his prose and analysis and he gets along really well with both sides,\" Rosen said. While abortion rights groups immediately criticized the nomination, Rosen said Gorsuch's record on the issue is sparse. In a book Gorsuch wrote laying out the case against assisted suicide and euthanasia, Rosen said, Gorsuch was careful to avoid making a religious case for his views, focusing instead on philosophy. \"He has been careful not to say what he thinks about abortion or marriage equality,\" Rosen said. In any event, with Kennedy remaining on the court, there are five votes to preserve abortion rights and gay rights, no matter Gorsuch's views. Should Kennedy, 80, or liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, or Stephen Breyer, 78, leave the court in the next four years, Trump then would have a chance to appoint a justice whose vote could perhaps flip the court on abortion, gay rights and a range of hot-button issues. It's unclear how quickly majority Republicans might be able to move Gorsuch's nomination through the Senate or whether Democrats will try to block him. Gorsuch could join the court in time for the last arguments of the term in the spring. The court currently has before it a case about the rights of transgender students, though the case could end up being returned to a lower court without a full hearing in the high court. Next term's big issue could be whether some partisan redistricting violates the Constitution. Critics of labor unions also are likely to bring before the court a case that could damage the financial viability of unions that represent government workers, an issue on which the court split 4-4 after Scalia's death. From his time on the appeals court, Gorsuch's notable opinions include defense of religious freedom. In two cases that involved the contraception mandate under the Obama health care law, Gorsuch sided with businesses and non-profit groups that voiced religious objections to the requirement that they provide cost-free contraception to women covered under their health plans. Gorsuch also has written opinions that question 30 years of Supreme Court rulings that allow federal agencies to interpret laws and regulations. Gorsuch has said that federal bureaucrats are allowed to accumulate too much power at the expense of Congress and the courts.  Those rulings \"permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design,\" he wrote last year. Justice Clarence Thomas has raised similar concerns. Notre Dame law professor John Copeland Nagle said he sees an irony in Trump's selection of Gorsuch. \"Who would have guessed that President Trump's most important decision in his first weeks in office would be to limit his own power?\" Nagle said. The choice of Gorsuch \"does just that.\" In background and style, Gorsuch resembles the group he may soon join. He would be the sixth member of the bench to have attended Harvard Law School; the other three have law degrees from Yale. Seven of the eight justices previously served as appeals court judges, Gorsuch's current job. He was a Supreme Court law clerk, along with three other justices. While he is a native Coloradan, Gorsuch spent his high school years in Washington because his mother, Anne Gorsuch, was EPA administrator in the Reagan administration. At 49 years old, he's the youngest nominee since Thomas, who was 43 when he joined the court more than 25 years ago. Gorsuch differs from his prospective colleagues in one respect. On a court with five Catholics and three Jews, he would be the lone Episcopalian. ___ Follow Mark Sherman at http://twitter.com/shermancourt", "hero": "Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump", "victim": "None", "villain": "None", "partisanship": "Center", "year": "2017", "model_hero": "<pad> Antonin Scalia would have said,\" Rosen said.</s>", "model_hero_score": 0.36902621388435364, "prompt_length_exceeded": true, "model_villain": "<pad> Trump is going to say,\" Rosen said.</s>", "model_villain_score": 0.29209399223327637, "model_victim": "<pad> Antonin Scalia would say,\" Rosen said.</s>", "model_victim_score": 0.3917684853076935, "duration": {"hero": 2.2194747924804688, "villain": 1.7753090858459473, "victim": 2.0728864669799805}}, {"article_id": "1181592100", "publication_date": "2019-02-02 03:00:36", "headline": "Venezuela: Socialists Arrest, Disappear Journalists to Prevent Protest Coverage", "url": "https://www.sgtreport.com/2019/02/venezuela-socialists-arrest-disappear-journalists-to-prevent-protest-coverage/", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "False", "themes": "", "media_id": "31827", "media_name": "sgtreport.com", "media_url": "http://sgtreport.com#spider", "origin_country": "US", "article_text": "by Francis Martel, Breitbart: The socialist regime of dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela has arrested 11 journalists the past two days, including two teams of Spanish and French journalists \u201cdisappeared\u201d into a political prison for 24 hours on Wednesday. The Spanish team, working with the newswire service EFE, resurfaced Thursday afternoon after being forced into \u201cEl Helicoide,\u201d the 1960s shopping-mall-turned-prison the Maduro regime uses to house its most prominent political prisoners. Maduro\u2019s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, issued a statement condemning international media outlets for sending journalists to cover the current wave of protests in the country that resulted in the legal ouster of Maduro\u2019s regime, replaced as mandated by the Venezuelan constitution with the head of the nation\u2019s federal legislature.  President Juan Guaid\u00f3 called for protests Wednesday to demand Maduro, who still controls the military, allow humanitarian aid in the country. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s tenure as interim president turned a week old Wednesday after he swore an\u00a0oath of office publicly on January 23, the anniversary of the establishment of a democratic Venezuela in 1958. Eyewitness reports\u00a0state\u00a0that members of the Venezuelan secret police, known by the acronym Sebin, entered the national headquarters of EFE Wednesday afternoon and whisked out three journalists: Spanish reporter\u00a0Gonzalo Dom\u00ednguez Loeda, Colombian reporter\u00a0Mauren Barriga Vargas, and Colombian photographer\u00a0Leonardo Mu\u00f1oz. Venezuelan human rights observers\u00a0reported\u00a0that police took the three to the Sebin headquarters in El Helicoide, but did not notify EFE of there whereabouts or anyone publically regarding why police arrested them. On the same day, Maduro forces\u00a0detained\u00a0French reporters Baptiste des Monstiers and Pierre Caille of the nation\u2019s\u00a0Quotidien TV. The outlet confirmed on Thursday that authorities released the reporters, who \u201cwill soon be back in Paris.\u201d The Venezuelan news outlet NTN24\u00a0reports\u00a0that 11 journalists so far have faced similar aggression in the past two days, taken away and \u201cdisappeared\u201d without explanation only to be abruptly released and forced to return home. Others similarly aggrieved include Chilean journalists\u00a0Gonzalo Barahona and Rodrigo P\u00e9rez, both deported on Thursday, and Venezuelan journalists\u00a0Maiker Yriarte and Ana Rodr\u00edguez, released after a ten-hour detention. The arrests of the foreign reporters, however, triggered an intercontinental outcry. Senior European Union official Federica Mogherini demanded the \u201cimmediate release\u201d of the journalists from the continent. The secretary-general of\u00a0Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Reporters Without Borders),\u00a0Christophe Deloire,\u00a0issued\u00a0an urgent demand for the crackdown on reporters to end, calling the arrests \u201cextremely unsettling.\u201d \u201cWe know the practices of the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regarding arbitrary detentions,\u201d he added. \u201cMaduro, through various diverse forms, wages a media war against journalists and foreign reporters are regularly expelled.\u201d Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero added his voice to the condemnation.\u00a0\u201cThis is what dictatorships do. Stomp on freedom of the press,\u201d he wrote in a statement\u00a0on Twitter demanding the release\u00a0of the Chileans detained\u00a0on Tuesday. Mu\u00f1oz,\u00a0one\u00a0of the Colombian EFE reporters, told journalists following his release Thursday afternoon that\u00a0officials had agreed not to deport his team. \u201cThey told us we didn\u2019t have a permit, but they said we could stay in the country,\u201d he explained, so long as they did not attempt to do their jobs.

Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth,\" Trump said. \"To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children\u2014born and unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God,\" Trump said. Faith leaders applauded the move. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for standing strong for the unborn and against the hideous acts of full term abortion! Thank you for standing for all Americans, our security, our economy, second chances, children with cancer, on & on! The State of the Union was brilliant and amazing! Thank you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for covering the priorities of our nation so clearly in tonight's State of the Union address. It is my prayer that all Americans would support working together in a bipartisan way to solve the problems we face. The most pro-life president just delivered the most pro-life State of the Union speech EVER. Not even close. No other President of the United States has ever been so bold in their words describing the national immoral horror and impact of late term abortion. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/UAByJPo1Pe Shawn Carney, president of 40 Days for Life: President Trump spoke common sense during his comments sharing his disgust with the ongoing support of abortion and infanticide in our country. His calling out the outrageous and cold comments from New York and Virginia lawmakers further adds to the national outcry of the barbaric nature of abortion and the sterile detachment of those who support it. Jason Yates, CEO of My Faith Votes: President Trump's address tonight called Americans to many things: unity, compromise, to honor the past and treasure the promise of the future. But the most important words from the president came as an earnest plea to Congress to pass legislation banning late-term abortions. This could not be more necessary. We cannot allow laws like those passed recently in New York and attempted in Virginia to define how America values life. People of faith agree with President Trump that 'all children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image of God,' and that defending the dignity of every person is part of what it means to be 'one nation, under God.' In addition to his fierce anti-abortion rhetoric, the president also addressed economic issues, jobs, paid maternity leave, Israel and more. Frank Gaffney, executive chairman of the Center for Security Policy: President Trump's State of the Union address last night was one of the finest I have ever heard. His report on our economic progress was inspiring. His profiles of American heroes in the audience were authentically moving. And his message coming into a sharply divided House chamber was an inspiring call, not simply for bipartisanship or unity, but to 'choose greatness.' In one particularly memorable passage, President Trump drew a sharp line between the source of our greatness and the alternative that some insist should be our future, instead. After depicting the latest national devastation at the hands of the radical left in Venezuela, Mr. Trump declared: 'America was founded on liberty and independence, not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will NEVER be a socialist country. Read on for the full transcript as provided by the White House: PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESSRemarks as prepared for delivery TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade\u2014the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution\u2014and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom\u2014a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs\u2014something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history \u2013- 157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty\u2014and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy\u2014the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone\u2014almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States\u2014and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate \u2013 some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population\u2014and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing\u2014and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence\u2014and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well\u2011being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration\u2014reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate\u2014it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities\u2014including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families \u2013 no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great\u2011granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: \"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.\" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement\u2014and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall\u2014but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier\u2014not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime\u2014one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before\u2014and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount\u2014reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods\u2014and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us\u2014I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried\u2014until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement\u2014or USMCA\u2014will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill\u2014and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs\u2014and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: \"Last Day of Chemo.\" Grace\u2014you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave\u2014so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children\u2014born and unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military\u2014with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO\u2014but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't \u2013- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom\u2014and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence \u2013- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism\u2014not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel\u2014and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor\u2014and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement\u2014but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole\u2014and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery\u2014but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall\u2014more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \"It's the Americans.\" A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \"To me,\" Joshua recalls, \"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.\" I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight\u2014seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America\u2014they did it for us. Everything that has come since\u2014our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol\u2014think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences\u2014or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance\u2014or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future\u2014our fate\u2014and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny\u2014that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you.

Will impeachment change that? Trump\u2019s States of the Union speeches have been one of the few places in his presidency that mostly follow the standard presidential script. He delivers a speech prepared by speechwriters, talks about a variety of policy priorities and honors a special guest (a tradition started by Ronald Reagan). In form and function, it\u2019s all been almost normal.1 This year, of course, the context surrounding Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech is anything but normal. The U.S. Senate will likely acquit Trump on two articles of impeachment this week . So the question is: Will Trump stick to the usual script, or will he tackle impeachment head-on? There are arguments and precedents that point to both scenarios. In the past, presidents facing scandal or impeachment have pushed back by saying those things \u2014 Watergate or other scandals, etc. \u2014 are just distractions from important policy issues that voters care about. The State of the Union address offers presidents an opportunity to highlight those issues, keeping the focus on his policy agenda. On the other hand, the State of the Union also allows presidents to publicly spin an impeachment or scandal. The framing war between presidents and their political opponents can affect how the public perceives an impeachment, even if that doesn\u2019t seem like how the process should work. So which tactic has been chosen by presidents who have faced this situation before? Bill Clinton delivered the 1999 State of the Union Address just a month after the House voted on four articles of impeachment \u2014 passing two of them \u2014 and a few weeks before the Senate voted to acquit him. Despite some Democrats joining Republicans in calling for the president to postpone the address until after the impeachment process had finished, Clinton proceeded with the speech as scheduled. His address, on Jan. 19, emphasized a variety of policy priorities, including preserving Social Security and improving public education, and he touted his own administration\u2019s record in domestic and foreign policy. Clinton never mentioned impeachment. He did, however, make several references to national unity. In a discussion of racial inequality, Clinton emphasized the shared fate of a united country: Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America. He referred to bipartisan priorities like medical research, education and Middle East peace. These fit in with standard State of the Union items, especially during a period of divided government. But in that political environment, they also functioned as a signal that the country should move on. Richard Nixon took a different approach in his 1974 State of the Union address. In it, he asked Congress to end the investigations, saying that \u201cone year of Watergate is enough.\u201d (This plea was, of course, unsuccessful, and Nixon resigned about six months later.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLInNam9XQE Nixon\u2019s remarks also included a pledge to cooperate with the investigation and a commitment to follow precedent \u201cfrom George Washington to Lyndon B. Johnson\u201d to avoid weakening the office of the presidency. These presidents all took advantage of the platform provided by the address to highlight his role as head of state and national figure. They mentioned shared values, bipartisan priorities and national history. Trump might try to do the same thing. But while both Watergate and the Clinton impeachment engendered deep partisan divisions, Nixon and Clinton enjoyed some advantages that Trump doesn\u2019t. Unlike Trump, Clinton had high approval ratings during his impeachment. And Nixon held office before the today\u2019s era of polarization and hyper partisanship. In other words, they could lean into the trappings of the presidency and messages of national unity in their addresses in the hopes of expanding their political support \u2014 in a way that Trump cannot. Of course, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what Trump will say. But the State of the Union, along with almost everything else in national politics related to the Trump White House, has become a lot more partisan. As we noted last year, these addresses aren\u2019t especially effective at moving public opinion or passing legislation, and presidents end up speaking to their own parties. (The TV audience is likely to be partisans who are already favorable to the president.) Given that, Trump\u2019s poor (and incredibly steady) approval ratings and contemporary polarization, it\u2019s unlikely the State of the Union speech will change many minds about the Ukraine scandal, impeachment or the Trump presidency more generally. Still, while partisan attitudes tend to be fairly solidified \u2014 with Republicans approving of Trump and disapproving of impeachment \u2014 the State of the Union could provide a useful opportunity for the administration to frame impeachment, especially for GOP-leaning voters. Sure, Trump already has sky-high approval ratings among Republicans, but that, to some extent, papers over Trump\u2019s weakness with people who support him. More generally, impeachment has proven surprisingly popular, with a higher percentage of Americans supporting the process than disapproving of it on average since October. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s impeachment poll tracker shows that through January, more Americans approved of impeachment than disapproved. But a speech addressed to a mostly partisan audience allows him to describe the impeachment as a (failed) attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election (as his defenders in Congress have argued) and to activate a sense of partisan team identity. In other words, this State of the Union might end up more closely resembling a rally speech, which would be a big break with norms. Such an approach would be substantively different from that of both Nixon and Clinton, both of whom tried to link their speeches to larger national values and priorities. It would also potentially highlight the distance between how partisans on different sides view the impeachment case. But Trump is a highly divisive president in a deeply polarized era. The State of the Union is still a national, ceremonial address \u2013 but the president may find political benefit in embracing its partisan potential. That said, the content has still carried a distinctly Trumpian message. In 2019, the president warned the new Democratic majority in the House to avoid investigations \u201cif there is to be peace and legislation.\u201d In his 2018 address, he suggested that \u201cAmericans are dreamers, too,\u201d angering Democrats by employing a term often used for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and using it to justify immigration restrictions.

Johnson, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Saturday. Johnson was the co-founder of what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s first trans organization, STAR (Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries) with Sylvia Rivera. Johnson became a prominent figure and icon for the LGBTQ movement in the immediate aftermath of the Stonewall Riots. STAR organized on behalf of LGBTQ youth and sex workers, also creating the STAR House to provide housing, community, and other ways of support. Related: Color of Pride: Marsha P. Johnson fearlessly paved the way for your civil rights The park, currently known as East River State Park, is located in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. It will be\u00a0the first park in New York named after an LGBTQ person. New York City pledged last year to build a monument to both Johnson and Rivera, but little details have been finalized since that announcement. New York artist Brian Kenney painted a mural of the pair in Dallas, Texas last year as well \u2014 which has since been vandalized. Cuomo\u2019s announcement came at the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Greater New York Gala. \u201cNew York state is the progressive capital of the nation, and while we are winning the legal battle for justice for the LGBTQ community, in many ways we are losing the broader war for equality,\u201d he remarked while decrying the record level of discrimination and hate crimes that have occurred within the Empire State. Within his 15-minute remarks, Cuomo called for a repeal of New York State\u2019s ban on paying surrogate mothers in favor of guideline measures that he believes will be an LGBTQ-friendly. He also expressed plans to streamline adoption policies within the state. \u201cMy goal has been to make New York State the leading champion in the nation for the LGBTQ community, to be the state that ended discrimination, bias, intolerance, and judgmentalism against members of the LGBTQ community,\u201d Cuomo said to the crowd. You can see the entirety of Gov. Cuomo\u2019s remarks below \u2013 he begins talking about Johnson at the 8:14 mark. Naomi Campbell, Kristin Chenoweth, Matthew Lopez, and Jeremy O. Harris were also honored at the event. \u201cPersonally I feel they should let her have her opinions,\u201d Carter said of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d actors who have criticized Rowling\u2019s transphobia.

We\u2019re going to get treated sh**ty and then get no tipped and possibly hate crimed.\u201d His message was clear: Do not let hate win. The MMA coach said he\u2019s just glad his kid isn\u2019t gay: \u201cGays have been very mean to me. They\u2019re bullies.\u201d Many accused the angry people of using the tweet as an excuse to boycott a company that supports trans people. \u201cThis is not a time to be afraid,\u201d one injured survivor said. \u201cThis is a time to come together.\u201d The Department of Defense provides gender-affirming surgeries for active-duty military personnel, but it denies this lifesaving care to dependents.", "entities": ["Governor of New York", "Andrew Cuomo", "Brooklyn", "Activism", "Marsha P.

In the story of a young child named James and an activist named Walt Heyer, the two issues converge \u2014 or intersect, as some might say \u2014 in a dramatic manner. James is the subject of a bitter custody dispute that could have lifelong consequences for him. According to his father, his mother says he prefers to be girl named \u201cLuna\u201d and dress in women\u2019s clothing. Yet, when he\u2019s with his father, Jeff Younger, James prefers to dress as a boy and shows no sign of gender dysphoria. Younger claims on his website SaveJames.com that James, now 6, has been dressed as a girl by his mother since he was 3. He also claims that his son is undergoing \u201csocial transitioning\u201d therapy as a prelude to receiving puberty-blocking drugs as early as age 8. The therapy is meant to make it easier for a full gender transition therapy at an older age, as the drugs inhibit features like facial hair and Adam\u2019s apples germane to biological males. In Heyer, Younger has found a high-profile advocate. \u201cThe case of James is very troubling to me because I know how the story unfolds,\u201d Heyer writes in a piece for The Federalist. \u201cMy grandmother dressed me as a girl when I was 4, 5, and 6 years old. Like James, I was far too young to comprehend the long-term consequences of being encouraged to cross-dress at such a young age, much less fight back. In my child\u2019s mind, it felt good to be the center of her attention. Now I call what grandma did to me \u2018child abuse\u2019 because her grooming of me as a female negatively affected my entire life. \u201cIn adulthood, I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and underwent unnecessary cross-gender hormone therapy and surgical gender change,\u201d he continues. \u201cI lived eight years as a woman and tried my best to make it work, but after surgery I still had gender dysphoria. Even worse, I was suicidal. Before giving me hormones and surgery, my medical providers should have helped me explore the possible psychological roots of my desire to escape into a female persona, but none did.\u201d Heyer began re-identifying as his biological sex and has since been a staunch adversary of the vast expansion of the procedure. As he notes in his article, published Wednesday, the vast majority of young people with gender dysphoria grow out of it by the time they reach adulthood. Yet, for those given puberty blockers, a paper by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health notes that \u201cin a follow-up study of 70 adolescents who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and given puberty suppressing hormones, all continued with the actual sex reassignment, beginning with feminizing/masculinizing hormone therapy.\u201d That\u2019s one study, but a world of difference which could suggest the puberty blocker drugs themselves could affect outcomes in gender dysphoria. That\u2019s not a trifle when it comes to children like James: Studies are mixed as to whether gender transitioning actually helps, with two major studies showing doctors finding the procedure ineffective and higher mortality rates among those who underwent reassignment surgery. Even the Obama-era\u00a0Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, certainly not a covert hive of transphobia, found that \u201c(b)ased on a thorough review of the clinical evidence available at this time, there is not enough evidence to determine whether gender reassignment surgery improves health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with gender dysphoria\u201d and refused to cover the procedure. Heyer says the results of the process on James would be horrifying. \u201cPuberty blockers and the following step, cross-sex hormones, are known to cause serious side effects, including infertility. Children are not able to understand these consequences or give informed consent,\u201d Heyer writes. \u201cJames is on track to be given these drugs.\u201d \u201cAnother opinion is so clearly needed. It\u2019s easy to see why this father is alarmed and fights so hard for his boy. An intervention is clearly needed and needed now. A second opinion needs to come from someone who is not a cheerleader for diagnosing gender dysphoria and preparing a child for a sex change. The ideal counselor will explore the family dynamics and other contributing factors.\u201d More importantly, he says, he\u2019s spent time with James and his family and says that if the child is putting on an act while he\u2019s with his father, it\u2019s certainly an impressive one for a 6-year-old. \u201cJeff and I drove across town to the mother\u2019s home to pick up the boys,\u201d Heyer writes. \u201cAs we pulled up, the front door opened, and the two young boys came flying out. James was dressed as a boy, like his brother. Into the backseat they went, saying hi to their dad and to me before they started talking about Ninja Turtles and other things they had done at school. Not one smidgeon of gender dysphoria or \u2018girl talk\u2019 appeared during the drive back to the Scott home.\u201d \u201cI observed James\u2019 mannerisms, voice inflections, and interactions, looking for evidence of gender dysphoria. I can emphatically say that during the two hours of the visit I saw no sign of gender dysphoria. James indicated no desire to be a girl, nor did he behave like a girl or talk like a girl during the entire time. Both James and his brother happily engaged with the four Scott children and the adults. Both were talkative, demonstrated strong vocabularies, and eagerly showed off their artwork created during a previous playdate.\u201d Instead, this all seems to manifest when he\u2019s with his mother, who has pressed the court into transgender therapy with Jeff Younger footing the bill, according to the father. Heyer isn\u2019t a medical professional, although he\u2019s an expert on his own experience, I suppose. He\u2019s also well-versed in the treatment regimen for transitioning when gender dysphoria has been diagnosed, which is called the Dutch protocol. He says that it\u2019s normalizing parental \u201cgrooming.\u201d \u201cSocial transition is the first step. James\u2019 mother has enrolled him in first grade as a girl with a girl name and dresses him as a girl for school,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial transition for a young child is not harmless. It\u2019s grooming. My grandmother dressed me as a girl when I was 4, 5, and 6 years old, which led to my own gender confusion.\u201d But this is what\u2019s being pushed as compassionate and progressive among liberal activists at the moment, even though we have roughly zero idea what will happen to children treated with the Dutch protocol 10, 20, 30 years down the line. Our knowledge is limited as to what damage puberty-blocking and this cocktail of pharmaceuticals will wreak on the bodies of individuals who made these choices long before they were adults \u2014 if there was any volition in the first place. That\u2019s not progressive. That\u2019s abusive, and it\u2019s time that society started realizing that. It\u2019s one thing when an adult decides to transition on their own, even if we can debate the efficacy of the process. It\u2019s quite another when it\u2019s done to children as young as 8, people who don\u2019t have the ability to comprehend decisions they\u2019re making about their health and are at the mercy \u2014 or the whim \u2014 of parents who have their own agenda.

She supports the Muslim Brotherhood, is an avowed supporter of Sharia law, and she praises the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, the noted hater of Jews. And she\u2019s on the record hating Roseanne Barr. Well, the 66-year-old comedian just told Sansour, \u201cB*tch shut up!\u201d And Roseanne was just getting started. You\u2019ll love this. Roseanne Barr is in Israel where she has been quite vocal about American politics. Barr is on the record as a devout Jew, and she sure doesn\u2019t like any nonsense, especially political correctness. The comedian is coming off of a tough year where she saw ABC yank her reboot of The Roseanne Show after the Trump supporter posted a misguided tweet about Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. Now, Barr is blasting the Women\u2019s March leaders in Tel Aviv, paying special attention to Linda Sarsour. Roseanne has had a long feud with the pro-Sharia Women\u2019s March leader. \u201cSarsour is a prominent Palestinian-American activist known for her anti-Israeli views. During an\u00a0interview\u00a0with the\u00a0Nation, Sarsour claimed those who identify as Zionists cannot be feminists because they are ignoring the rights of Palestinian women,\u201d the Free Beacon reported. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense for someone to say, \u2018Is there room for people who support the state of Israel and do not criticize it in the movement?\u2019 There can\u2019t be in feminism. You either stand up for the rights of all women, including Palestinians, or none. There\u2019s just no way around it,\u201d Sarsour said. Sarsour also has a history of also supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. She tweeted back in 2011 when the Muslim Brotherhood came to power in Eygpt: \u201cYo the Muslim Brotherhood knows how to parrrttaaay! So much for radical islamists taking over! If these r \u2013 they r da coolest! #jan25 #Egypt.\u201d Yo the Muslim Brotherhood knows how to parrrttaaay! So much for radical islamists taking over! If these r \u2013 they r da coolest! #jan25 #Egypt \u2014 Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) February 12, 2011  These statements from Sarsour started the feud with Barr, who took to social media and let the pro-Sharia law Women\u2019s March leader know she wasn\u2019t buying it.\u00a0Barr tweeted a\u00a0response to Sarsour, \u201cIs it even possible to be a pro-Palestinian feminist?\u201d She made the point that in Muslim countries women are treated like property and second-class citizens. Sarsour had no good comeback and immediately blocked Roseanne on Twitter. Now, the outspoken comedian just ripped Sarsour and her cohorts in front of a crowd of 500 in Israel. \u201cBarr made her comments during a Q&A session following a panel she gave alongside longtime friend\u00a0Rabbi Shmuley Boteach in Tel Aviv earlier this week,\u201d Breitbart reports. One audience member asked Barr what she thought of the Women\u2019s March, to which the comedian answered: \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201d \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve fought to have women\u2019s voices in the media and every other place,\u201d she said, \u201cbut here I\u2019m like \u2018Bitch, shut up.\u2019\u201d Her swipe was met with cheers and applause from the 500-strong crowd of Israelis and new immigrants.\u00a0Barr went on to say that hostility within the Women\u2019s March defeated its purpose of defending human rights \u2014 and in particular, those of women. \u201cIf you\u2019re out there advocating for war and pain and division, it doesn\u2019t seem real feminist to me,\u201d she said. Indeed, this is what Sarsour is all about. Just last November, the original leader of the Women\u2019s March, Teresa Shook, called for Sarsour to step down, Fox News reported. Shook pointed out that\u00a0Sarsour was condemned for saying the criticism against Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar over her support for the boycott of Israel (called BDS) is led by \u201cfolks who masquerade as progressives but always choose their allegiance to Israel over their commitment to democracy and free speech.\u201d And last year, Sarsour blamed \u201cthe Jewish media\u201d for her and Farrakhan\u2019s controversial reputation and pushed back against any accusations of anti-Semitism, added Fox News. But Roseanne wasn\u2019t done. Whatever opinions one has of Roseanne, she has a history of speaking the truth. \u2014 Doreen Henricks (@JlyLarkspur) January 30, 2019  Well, the 66-year-old Trump supporter made sure Sarsour\u2019s good buddies recently elected to Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, know she isn\u2019t going to let them get away with anything. Both support the BDS movement which is a boycott of Israeli business worldwide. \u201cWe have Hamas in Congress,\u201d Roseanne said, referring to Omar and Tlaib, adding that BDS has \u201cinfected\u201d the Democratic Party.\u00a0\u201cBDS is another incarnation of Jew-hating. It\u2019s a boycott of Jewish business worldwide,\u201d she\u00a0told Breitbart, before adding that BDS is comparable to the \u201cNazi boycott on Jewish business.\u201d Many will remember Omar was busted for posting a tweet claiming the Covington MAGA kids were taunting \u201c5 black men,\u201d and screamed, \u201cit\u2019s not rape if you enjoy it.\u201d After an attorney representing the kids warned Omar that he would sue her for her blatant lies, the Congresswoman deleted the tweet.\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Rashida Tlaib is best known for calling the president a \u201cmother-f*cker.\u201d Omar and Tlaib are also under heavy scrutiny for their antisemitic remarks.\u00a0In December, Tlaib became the\u00a0second lawmaker\u00a0(along with Rep. Ilhan Omar,) to back the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, which\u00a0she claims\u00a0brings to light Israel\u2019s \u201cracism and \u2026 international human rights violations,'\u201d the Washington Examiner reported, who added the State Department\u2019s definition of Anti-Semitism. So when Roseanne claims that \u201cHamas is in Congress,\u201d many Americans agree. As for Linda Sarsour, the supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood remains a leader of the leftist Women\u2019s March, which should give any supporter of that movement cause to denounce it. Sadly, too many women who support the leftist movement have no scruples and showed up for the last Women\u2019s March despite Sarsour\u2019s presence. Roseanne Barr can be brass, but she hits the nail on the head time after time. Her devotion to Israel should be applauded, not derided. She is a true American patriot who speaks her mind and is a breath of fresh air for those of us who are constantly attacked by the Hollywood crowd. Rob Reiner made the mistake of buying into the Democrats narrative that it would be smooth sailing to impeach President Donald Trump. Now, the actor who famously played \u201cMeathead\u201d is really, really angry. \u201cDonald Trump has perverted the office of the Presidency,\u201d Reiner said. \u201cHe is defecating on our Constitution. For the love & life of our Country, the time has come to stop f*cking around. Impeach!\u201d Well, that\u2019s when Americans gave him a huge reality check. [\u2026] Rep. Ilhan Omar claimed today she is \u201cdoing the work the people sent her to do,\u201d and now she is co-sponsoring a new bill which would prohibit using the term \u201cillegal alien.\u201d Yes, that is what she is wasting her time and your taxpayer dollars on\u2014 it also goes against our First Amendment rights. Well, President Donald Trump just taught Omar a big lesson about what the American people want. You\u2019ll love this. [\u2026] President Donald Trump recently claimed Barack and Michelle Obama had a \u201cten-foot wall\u201d around their expensive digs in the Kalorama neighborhood in Washington, DC. Immediately, the mainstream media called the president a \u201cliar\u201d saying Trump\u2019s claims are 100% false. That\u2019s when one brave reporter showed up at the Obama compound. You\u2019ll love this. [\u2026] Following the \u201cMillion Man MAGA Rally\u201d held in Washington, D.C., the Electoral College count started on Capitol Hill. Vice-President Mike Pence issued a statement minutes before the certification process, and many say that it caused Trump supporters to storm Capitol Hill. Then, shots were fired inside the building. Don\u2019t miss this. [\u2026] Kamala Harris is once again embroiled in a huge controversy. This time Joe Biden\u2019s running mate is being accused of lying and plagiarizing Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s own testimony about a little girl attending a freedom march in the 1960s. You don\u2019t want to miss this. [\u2026] Utah Senator Mitt Romney was waiting for his flight to Washington, D.C. late Tuesday night when Trump supporters questioned his support of Joe Biden and desertion of his own party\u2019s president, Donald Trump. Romney made the mistake of making excuses, and that\u2019s when he got torched. Don\u2019t miss this. [\u2026] According to recent polls, many Americans believe the Democrats are trying to steal the election, and we can say \u201care trying\u201d because of the brilliance of the framers of the Constitution. The constitutional process of electing the president is not over yet. You don\u2019t want to miss how this could become the worst nightmare for Joe Biden and his supporters. [\u2026] Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller reportedly ordered a halt to cooperation with the transition team of Joe Biden, resulting in canceled meetings building-wide. While the liberal press is attempting to downplay this development, Trump advisors are celebrating the move. You don\u2019t want to miss this. [\u2026] Texas State Elector Matt Patrick testified on Capitol Hill on Thursday making bombshell allegations against Chief Justice John Roberts. Patrick claimed a SCOTUS staffer\u2019s damning testimony alleges Roberts\u2019 \u201cmoral cowardice\u201d lead to a massive fight in chambers over the Texas election lawsuit. Some are now calling for Roberts to step down immediately. Don\u2019t miss this. [\u2026] President Donald Trump is reported to be pushing for a Special Counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. This could lead to a much bigger crisis than we have witnessed in 2020 and be the Democrats\u2019 dream come true. You don\u2019t want to miss this. [\u2026] Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney is making it known he believes President Donald Trump has no choice but to invoke the Insurrection Act. That was echoed by a Republican state senator in North Carolina. Also, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications and Director of Social Media for the White House made a cryptic post on Facebook. Don\u2019t miss this. [\u2026] Rep. Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton are two of the Democrats who are freaking out after GOP electors voted for President Donald Trump. In fact, there\u2019s a video going viral that theorizes \u201cseveral paths to victory\u201d available to President Trump. You don\u2019t want to miss this.

Dan had the moral courage to expose them. https://www.gofundme.com/manage/lets-help-dan-abshear-big-pharma-whistleblower \u201cThere is a pathologically intimate relationship between corporations and the U.S. government- their collusion is expressed in the revolving door. \u201c In the Spring of 2006, I became a pharmaceutical corporate whistle blower. In February of that year, I had recruited a law firm with experience in pharmaceutical whistle blower lawsuits in Boston, which is a top place to file and submit pharmaceutical whistle blower cases.\u00a0 They agreed to represent me after I submitted a ten page document to them I composed- explaining why the wrongdoing of my employer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, needed to be addressed.\u00a0 They represented me on complete contingency, which meant that they would not be paid if they did not succeed in the whistle blower lawsuit they were submitting for me. The law firm submitted the whistle blower lawsuit against Novartis in April of 2006.\u00a0 And it was filed under seal, which means that I and my legal council cannot discuss the case whatsoever.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trick played by the D.O.J., to eliminate the possibility of media contact. I made a trip to Boston in July of 2006 to be asked hundreds of questions by various relevant government entities, such as the department of health and human services.\u00a0 Also, in the center of a large table in a conference room, was a phone, with numerous attorney generals from various states- all there to hear my answers to the hundreds of questions I was asked one day, for 8 hours.\u00a0 I spoke with complete knowledge of the evidence, and with total honesty.

WOMEN ARE ALWAYS WITH THE SUCCESSFUL !\nTHEREFORE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE SEDUCTION\nOF MEN !\none has to know from birth on that in this world\nyou cannot rely on anybody ! As a former whistleblower this article supports my years of contention that to ascend in any human institution, even in government and politics, you have to leave your conscience at the door. One can never regret serving the truth and what is right.  Henry\u2019s article also supports the view of just how morally corrupt all of our institutions really are, how the ends always justify the means to those in power, and that those at the so-called \u201ctop\u201d reflect by their deeds the very worst in our human natures.  Just this one example shows the corruption in major drug corporations, our government agencies, our flake politicians sitting in our useless legislatures, the medical community, the legal profession, and in our courts. There is not one spot on the carcass of our body politic which is not covered with putrid puss and sores, a body which has never suffered a cleansing bath much less any real purgation, and all coming from a completely filthy mind in control.

I\u2019m not surprised that whistleblowers find themselves on a secret blacklist. Decades ago I became unemployable in my local area. I don\u2019t remember exactly what my \u201ccrime\u201d had been. I certainly wasn\u2019t a whistleblower. I wasn\u2019t even a member of a trade union. All I can assume after so long is that it had something to do with my strong sense of injustice, whether committed against myself or another. I had a number of promising job interviews, but every one ended with a statement to the effect that there were other applicants, so \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know\u201d, but they never did. Around that time the local paper ran a story about claims made by others that the employment offices operated a blacklist. They denied this, of course, but they did admit that they would sometimes \u201cnot recommend\u201d certain people for employment and to have a secret number for potential employers to ring to learn about job applicants. If that\u2019s not blacklisting, I don\u2019t know what is. In the end I had to move away and find casual work using a false name until I discovered that this particular blacklist didn\u2019t extend to my new home town, by which time I\u2019d successfully built a reputation as the reliable worker I always had been. If there are blacklists operating at the local level involving low-level employment, it seems obvious to me that there would be something much more sinister and all-pervading at the \u201chigher end\u201d of the jobs market.

Christopher Brauchli \"If wishes were horses,Beggars might ride.\" \u2014John Ray, English Proverbs They have a lot in common\u2014the offices they once held, and their treatment of people. There is only one thing they do not have in common and it's what he wanted more than almost anything in the world. Here is what they have in common. She will be out of office for at least a year, having been removed from office by a military coup. He was removed from office as a result of an election in which votes were stolen from him and given to President Joe Biden by poll workers and other corrupt officials. Those people, he and his advisers would tell you, were the equivalent of the Myanmar military removing Aung San Suu Kyi from office for one year. Unlike former President Donald Trump, Suu Kyi enjoyed a distinguished career before events of 2017 took place. When she returned to Myanmar from England in 1988, she was placed under house arrest and kept there for 15 years becoming a global symbol for democracy. In 1991 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Following her release from house arrest in 2010, she became an internationally recognized symbol of the coming of democracy to Myanmar. In 2012 she was awarded the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal. During a visit to Myanmar in 2012, President Barack Obama described her as \"an icon of democracy who has inspired so many people, not just in this country but all around the world.\" In 2015 such accolades clearly distinguished her from Trump upon whom no one would shower such accolades. In the 2015 election in Myanmar, the National League for Democracy, of which Suu Kyi was a member, gained a parliamentary majority and Suu Kyi became the state counsellor, the equivalent of prime minister. The Rohingya and other observers thought that with her ascendance into power they would be treated as rightful citizens. They were to be disappointed. Suu Kyi and Trump have more in common than their removal from office. They both, to the dismay of the world and their own citizens, treated the unwanted in similar fashion. In the case of Suu Kyi, it was approving the military's treatment of the Rohingya Muslims who have lived in Myanmar for generations. In the case of Trump it was the treatment of immigrants seeking to enter the United States and establish lives here. In the case of Trump, families seeking asylum in the United States without permission were forcibly rendered asunder. Undocumented asylum-seekers were imprisoned. Accompanying children under the age of 18 were given to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services where they were shipped to assorted venues for eventual resettlement. As of this writing the parents of 628 migrant children separated from their families due to Trump administration policies at the U.S.-Mexico border between 2017 and 2018 have still not been located. Things were even worse in Suu Kyi's Myanmar. In a government-sponsored military action in 2017, more than a thousand Rohingyans were killed or raped, or burned to death by the military. More than a million Rohingya were driven from their homes and now live in refugee camps in Bangladesh. U.N. investigators said the military operations had \"genocidal intent.\" Nonetheless, as those atrocities were taking place, Suu Kyi defended the actions of the military saying, \"the military's actions were an appropriate response to a Rohingya militia uprising,\" and describing the generals who were accused of genocide as \"quite sweet.\" Both Trump and Suu Kyi will always be remembered for their treatment of their fellow human beings during their time in power. There is, however, one significant difference between Suu Kyi and Trump, and it is a difference that will forever trouble Trump. Whenever people think of Suu Kyi, they will also remember that Suu Kyi is the recipient of something Trump wanted more than almost anything else in the world\u2014the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump made no secret of his desire for that. In a self-aggrandizing moment at a campaign rally in January of the last year of his presidency, he complained about the fact that Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, was the winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. As Trump explained in his typically succinct style: \"I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of the country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said: 'What, did I have something to do with it?' Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is... I saved a big war, I've saved a couple of them.\" Mr. Abiy was awarded the prize on October 11, 2019 and gave his acceptance speech in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2019. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump both congratulated Mr. Abiy on receiving the award. As we were to learn after the 2020 presidential election, when Trump loses, he does not congratulate the winner. Mr. Abiy never heard from Trump. As noted at the outset, Trump and Suu Kyi will be remembered for some of the same reasons. But to his ever-lasting distress, Trump will never be remembered for having received the Nobel Peace Prize.

On February 1, Burma\u2019s military put an end to the country\u2019s ten-year experiment with democracy with a coup that can best be described as a partial \u201cself-coup.\u201d Tatmadaw (as the armed forces are known locally) already held considerable power and virtually total autonomy from civilian oversight, according to a power arrangement designed by the junta that ruled the country between 1988 and 2011. The takeover is puzzling for its apparent irrationality: Why would the generals now take the risk of dismantling the system they have so painstakingly built, which has served them well so far, and does not seem to be immediately threatened? After all, the coup removed a civilian government, led by the Nobel laureate and former dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, that after its first five-year term had given ample proof that it did not pose any threat to the military\u2019s interests. Instead, it had proven to share a virtually identical worldview. It had been a decade since the establishment of a so-called discipline-flourishing democracy carefully managed by the generals. This arrangement was initially praised by investors and the very same Western countries that had hitherto isolated Burma for the human rights violations committed by a military that had ruled the country in different iterations for almost fifty years. But this Monday, the commander in chief of the Tatmadaw, senior general Min Aung Hlaing, took power a few hours before the first session in parliament since November\u2019s elections. That vote had given Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) a resounding victory. But the coup followed weeks of unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, first from the losing Tatmadaw\u2019s proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), and then from the military itself. Aung San Suu Kyi was put immediately under arrest, along with some members of her government and a few dozen activists and critics of the military. She is now charged with illegally importing communications equipment. Min Aung Hlaing now leads a military government under a state of emergency. He has promised that he will rule for just one year and will devolve power after organizing fresh and clean elections, but few trust he will keep his word, and, given historic precedents, there are more than reasonable fears of a bloodbath when the military crushes the movements of popular resistance that are already emerging. The allegations of electoral fraud used to justify the coup are obviously a mere facade, all the more flimsy coming from the military that organized in 2008 a sham referendum to approve an undemocratic constitution and, two years later, a highly controlled election, boycotted by the NLD, in which the highly unpopular USDP obtained a dubious victory that marked the beginning of the transition. While some irregularities may have taken place in the last election, they would have done little to alter the final result in a country where Suu Kyi and her party remain wildly popular. There has been some speculation that the commander in chief, approaching his retirement later this year, wanted to protect himself and his assets. But, again, if there is something that Suu Kyi has made clear since she took power in 2016, it is that she won\u2019t go against the generals. With scant information available at the moment, any attempt to make sense of the coup can only be tentative \u2014 looking for a rational explanation may well prove pointless. The military has claimed the move is legal, and there is much discussion about whether the takeover has followed proper procedures or whether the controversy around the election amounted to a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d that could \u201cdisintegrate the Union or disintegrate national solidarity,\u201d according to the article in the constitution invoked by the putschists. But debates about the \u201clegality\u201d of the move are largely beside the point. The generals wrote the law and interpret it \u2014 and law in contemporary Burma is a very flexible excuse that mostly serves to give a veneer of legitimacy to the use of power. A look at the very particular system created by the old junta only makes things more puzzling. The constitution gives the military control over the three key security ministries \u2014 Defense, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs \u2014 reserves 25 percent of seats in parliament to soldiers handpicked by the commander in chief, and grants the Tatmadaw total power over its own affairs, as well as blanket immunity against any prosecution for the crimes routinely committed in the several wars against ethnic armed groups in the periphery of the country. Suu Kyi has repeatedly pledged to change the constitution to reduce the power of the military, but ever since she became an MP after a by-election held in 2012, she has accepted the rules of the game laid out by the generals, and changing the constitution is virtually impossible, as it requires the votes of more than 75 percent of the parliament and a referendum in which more than half of eligible voters have to approve the proposed amendments. In this way, the Tatmadaw has managed to protect its interests, which include vast business conglomerates, but also fulfill what it has always seen as its historic mission: to preserve the unity of a country besieged by armed conflicts ever since its independence from the British in 1948. In the first five years of the transition, when the ex-general Thein Sein was the president after the USDP victory in the sham 2010 election, Aung San Suu Kyi contributed to give legitimacy to that system, both domestically and internationally. When she and some members of her party became MPs in 2012, they did little to challenge the government. Her strategy at the time consisted mainly in gaining the trust of the military in the name of \u201cnational reconciliation\u201d and discouraging any kind of mass movement that could jeopardize her rapprochement with the generals. Meanwhile, as the Thein Sein administration was engaging in a peace process with several ethnic armed groups, an old war was reignited in mid-2011 between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) after a fragile cease-fire that had lasted for seventeen years. Tens of thousands were displaced from their homes in the rugged mountains of Kachin State, in the north of the country, where the Burmese army committed atrocities against the civilian population. But Suu Kyi refused to commit herself on the issue \u2014 alleging that the issue was \u201cup to the government.\u201d Then, in mid-2012, a succession of waves of sectarian violence shook the western state of Arakan, pitting the Rakhine, the mostly Buddhist ethnic group dominant there, and the Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim minority that had suffered persecution for decades on the false grounds that they are \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d from Bangladesh. There was ample evidence that high officials in government had stoked anti-Rohingya sentiment and that the security forces took sides with Rakhine mobs in the violence, but Suu Kyi again refused to \u201ctake sides\u201d and posed the problem as one of lack of \u201crule of law,\u201d while others in her party and the old pro-democracy camp were more vocal in publicly attacking the Rohingya. Around that time, there emerged a nationwide ultranationalist movement led by Buddhist monks that portrayed Burmese Muslims as the vanguard of an international jihad to Islamize the country, provoking new waves of anti-Muslim violence in several towns in central Burma. Suu Kyi was mostly muted, but when the election came in November 2015, her party decided not to field a single Muslim candidate, for fear of alienating its Buddhist base. Back then, it was easy to believe that Suu Kyi was bidding her time and, keeping her cards close to her chest, she was trying to avoid alienating the Tatmadaw in order to be able to gain power and then introduce a reformist agenda. But her first term in office after winning the elections in 2015 frustrated those expectations. Imbued by a strong sense of destiny, first because she is daughter of the \u201cfather of modern Burma\u201d \u2014 the national hero Aung San, assassinated months before independence \u2014 and then because of her popularity both at home and abroad, she patiently waited for more than a quarter of a century to rule her country. In power, she has proved to have little idea of what to do with it, her lack of a clear political vision oddly mixed with a seemingly boundless self-confidence and a penchant for authoritarianism and micromanagement. Barred from the presidency by a clause in the constitution that prevents those with close foreign relatives from reaching the highest position \u2014 her two sons are British citizens \u2014 she created the position of \u201cstate counselor\u201d and reserved for herself the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, effectively putting herself \u201cabove the president.\u201d The military grudgingly accepted an arrangement that arguably stretched the letter and the spirit of the constitution, and she was allowed at last to lead the government. Otherwise, she would adhere scrupulously to the constitution, without trying to find loopholes that could help her to implement new policies. Instead of focusing on issues that were under the purview of the ministries she controlled, like introducing reforms in the neglected education and health care systems, she made the main priority of her government to solve a problem over which she had no control: the wars between the Tatmadaw and the ethnic armed groups fighting for autonomy. She dismissed the team that had worked on the peace process during the previous administration, only to stand behind the very same National Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) designed by the Thein Sein government and endorsed by the Tatmadaw. In this case, as in many others, Suu Kyi showed a perplexing tendency to assume as much control as possible, only to basically follow the same approach as her predecessors. In these conditions, the peace process during her term was an abject failure, with only a few insignificant armed groups signing the NCA. In fact, the new cabinet was a mixture of Suu Kyi\u2019s loyalists, apolitical technocrats, and stalwarts of the old regime, apparently confirming that, if the transition meant anything, it was a merger of two elites \u2014 the higher echelons of the military and the historic pro-democracy leaders \u2014 again in the guise of \u201cnational reconciliation.\u201d The economic elites \u2014 the infamous \u201ccronies\u201d that had made their fortunes plundering the country\u2019s natural resources through their contacts with the junta \u2014 kept their place in the new order, too, with the state counselor limiting herself to admonishing them to \u201cwork for others in the future.\u201d She has also adhered to the neoliberal programs that the generals had tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s, when international sanctions, corruption, and cronyism crushed the economy, and only started to take off during the transition, without doing anything to tackle the huge inequalities prevalent in the country. In parliament, her party left untouched most oppressive laws passed during the military dictatorship, despite having the majority, and the government used them profusely to jail journalists and activists critical of both the government and the military. Then came a new crisis in Arakan, where a new militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) emerged in October 2016 attacking the headquarters of Border Guard Police in Northern Arakan, eliciting a brutal response by the Tatmadaw. One year later, ARSA attacked again, and the military unleashed its full fury against the Rohingya population in Northern Arakan, killing thousands of civilians, torching entire villages, gang-raping scores of women, and sending more than seven hundred thousand traumatized refugees, around three-quarters of the total Rohingya population, to Bangladesh, where they still languish in the biggest refugee camp in the world, with no prospects of returning home. Aung San Suu Kyi and the civilian administration were not in control of the military operations, but her government fully supported them, denying well-documented reports of atrocities and putting the state media at the service of a propaganda campaign defending the Tatmadaw and portraying the Rohingya as an existential threat, often with chillingly dehumanizing connotations. Burma was accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and Suu Kyi led the defense in 2019, arguing that the military operations were a legitimate response against terrorism and defending the role of the rotten system of justice in Burma in persecuting any possible excess committed during the onslaught. That marked the point when she definitely went from human rights icon to despised accomplice of a genocide in the eyes of many abroad, but it boosted her popularity at home, where the Rohingya have few friends, and her intervention was disingenuously portrayed by the official propaganda as an almost heroic defense of the Burmese nation as a whole, rather than the state. Given this story, the recent coup seems to make little sense, especially considering the unpopularity of the Tatmadaw and the role of Suu Kyi in legitimizing its \u201cdemocratic\u201d system. But tensions between the military and the civilian government have been brewing for some time and have rapidly deteriorated since the election, as a result of the former\u2019s complaints of fraud and the latter\u2019s refusal to take them seriously. Apart from the complaints of fraud by the military and the refusal of the civilian government to take them seriously, there is another issue that has strained relations between them: recent developments in the war in Arakan between the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army (AA), a Rakhine ethnonationalist guerrilla armed group (not to be mistaken for the Rohingya militants of ARSA). Founded in 2009, two years ago the AA ramped up its attacks on the military in the state, where it counts on wide popular support among a population that sees the central government, dominated by the Bamar majority, as invaders. The war in Arakan has turned into the most violent conflict in the country, while the government excluded the AA from the peace talks and declared it a terrorist organization in March 2020. Some weeks before the elections, the AA kidnapped three NLD candidates, and shortly after the Union Election Commission decided to cancel the polls in most of the state alleging security reasons. But shortly after, conversations between the Tatmadaw and the AA resulted in an informal cease-fire. The AA issued a statement calling for elections in the whole of the state, where the NLD is likely to lose, and the military supported the proposal, but Suu Kyi\u2019s government refused to organize them, even after her three candidates were released on January 1. In a situation in which both the NLD and the Tatmadaw feel entitled to wield ultimate power, the perceived slights of an increasingly assertive Suu Kyi and her unwillingness to cooperate with them on Arakan seem to have been too much to swallow for the generals, and in a pique that has escalated in the last months, they may have decided that it was necessary \u201cto put her in her place\u201d and reassert their dominance. The coup has already elicited wide condemnation among leaders in the West, which is again threatening the same kind of sanctions that failed to make any dent in the Tatmadaw during the military dictatorship. There is an assumption that the generals, who had taken Western leaders for fools at the beginning of the transition, care about how they are perceived abroad \u2014 but that is just a myth that has proven false time and again. This is no less true with this putsch, which has also shown how little the men in uniform care about how they are perceived within their own country. Thus seems to have come to an end, for the moment at least, the inglorious political career of Aung San Suu Kyi \u2014 the woman destined to rule her country but who didn\u2019t know what to do with her power once she obtained it, and used it to defend the most atrocious crimes. The paradox of Suu Kyi is that she has governed with a strange mix of caution \u2014 not implementing any policy that could harm the interests of the Tatmadaw \u2014 and arrogance\u2014not consulting or listening to the soldiers with whom she was supposed to share power. If this first approach made her civilian government powerless to effect any meaningful change, the latter has ultimately led to her downfall. There is little reason to express sympathy for her. Our solidarity should go to the millions of ordinary Burmese who have suffered under military rule \u2014 and will probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

So many of its buildings, once gorgeous, were in an advanced state of decay. This city looked better before World War II, for sure, and certainly a century ago. Since escaping Communism, Budapest is regaining its glories, though not at the same pace as Prague. There\u2019s a peculiar local fad called ruin pubs, where hip types can drink and dance in these half wrecked buildings. Too creaky to boogie, I only glimpsed them from the outside, but they didn\u2019t look half bad. In the subway concourses, there were many homeless, and they stayed there all day. Other aimless types loitered. The underground shops offered food, drinks, magazines and flowers. Some were owned by Chinese. At street level, there were many gyro shops run by Greeks, Turks or just plain Hungarians. According to the 2011 census, 7.3% of Budapest residents were foreign-born, but most were just ethnic Hungarians arriving from Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. Before World War II, there were 200,000 Jews in Budapest and they had the largest synagogue in all of Europe. Half would be massacred by Germans and their Hungarian allies. In the countryside, a Jew\u2019s chance of survival was even worse. Many Gypsies were also killed. Estimates of Gypsies in Hungary range from 3.1 to more than 10%. Thanks to a high birthrate, that percentage is constantly increasing. Many of the most famous Hungarians were, well, not Hungarian, as in Magyar. Franz Liszt was German. Bela Bartok was half German and a quarter Serbian. Houdini, Robert Capa, Arthur Koestler and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz were Jews. Hungary has gotten much bad press lately because of Viktor Orban. Newsweek compared him to Mussolini, and John McCain described him as \u201ca neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin.\u201d When Orban became Prime Minister in 1998, he integrated Hungary into NATO so was seen as snugly in the Western camp, but with his second stint as Hungary\u2019s leader, from 2010 to now, Orban has made some bold moves against both Brussels and Washington. What has been most highlighted and lambasted is Orban\u2019s stance on the current refugee/illegal immigrant crisis, but some of his other decisions are even more rebellious against the hegemony of the AngloZionists, to borrow a term from the Saker. Orban rejected the IMF\u2019s austerity measures, increased Hungary\u2019s oversight over its Central Bank, raised taxes for all banks and, in 2013, even kicked out the International Monetary Fund. Orban\u2019s moves against banksters have not been foregrounded by the international press because banksters and their allies don\u2019t want you to think too much about their rampant criminal activities. In defiance of the AngloZionists\u2019 effort to isolate Russia, Orban\u2019s government agreed in 2014 to have South Stream go through Hungary. This Russian gas pipeline would also have crossed Turkey\u2019s territorial waters, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Slovenia and Austria. Though it would have benefited all of Europe, South Stream was scuttled by our global elites through pressure on Bulgaria. In contrast to Hungary\u2019s decision, Poland has gone out of its way to avoid relying on Russian natural gas by arranging in 2006 to buy from distant Qatar. Thanks to a delay in the construction of a sea terminal, Poland still hasn\u2019t quaffed any Qatar liquefied natural gas, though it\u2019s already paying through its nose due to contractual obligations. Huffing the Russian stuff costs a lot less. Besides seeking closer ties with Russia, Orban has repeatedly stressed that sanctions against Russia hurts all European countries. What he\u2019s advocating, then, is a Europe that must look out for its own interests in defiance of the suicide diktats from the AngloZionists. In 2011, Orban banned GMO crops from Hungary and destroyed 1,000 acres of corn planted with Monsanto seeds. Also of note is Orban\u2019s reaching out to Hungarians in neighboring countries. His government has provided monetary aid and even citizenship to all ethnic Hungarians (with the stipulation that one must speak the language to be naturalized). Thanks to the vindictive Treaty of Trianon after World War I, Hungary lost 71% of its land and 66% of its people. Not even Germany was truncated so ruthlessly. Orban\u2019s government has revoked tax-exemption status from most Hungarian religious organizations, including all versions of Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Baha\u2019i, all but three Jewish synagogues, as well as many Christian orders or denominations such as Opus Dei, Benedictines, Marists, Carmelites, Mormons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists, Episcopalians and Methodists. The only ones to receive state recognition and support are those deemed traditional to Hungarian society. Echoing Putin and other leaders, Orban has condemned NGOs as a fifth column. Though as a young man, Orban received a four-month scholarship from the Soros Foundation to study in Oxford, he is fingering the Budapest-born Soros as an unwelcome meddler in Hungary and the rest of Europe. Thanks for the chump change, George, but bugger off! What you have, then, is a nationalist leader, and in Europe, we haven\u2019t seen one in a long while who\u2019s so unapologetic without sounding shrill. In his speeches and interviews, Orban explains himself quite clearly and candidly. To Die Weltwoche, a Swiss newspaper, Orban said in November of 2015, \u201cThere are terms and concepts which for a long time could not be uttered, but which are once again beginning to form part of public discourse. For example, \u2018borders\u2019\u2014are they good or bad? We can once again say that they have their good sides. Or \u2018nation\u2019: this word can once again be used in a positive sense. \u201cChristianity\u201d: most European leaders \u2013 including myself \u2013 are advised not to use this word too frequently, because most Europeans no longer feel Christian. Now, however, this word is once again returning to political debates. Or \u2018pride,\u2019 as in \u2018the pride of a nation\u2019: once again it has become a legitimate expression. A positive consequence of the migration crisis is that once again we are attempting to talk openly about our continent\u2019s identity\u2014more freely than in the past two decades.\u201d The refugee/illegal immigration crisis has also exposed the impotence of the European Union, \u201cThis negative impression over the EU\u2019s helplessness already existed before the migration crisis. The citizens of Europe saw it during the financial crisis and the crisis over Greece. They criticized their politicians for not being able to find a way out of the financial crisis. The stagnation of our national economies is still evident [\u2026] European citizens are convinced that their leaders are not effective. The migration crisis has, however, created a new impression. This is not related to effectiveness, but to democracy.\u201d With citizens having no inputs, and most European leaders unable to make decisions in their nation\u2019s interests, one is left to wonder who are behind all this mayhem? Orban, \u201cIt is hard to shake off this thought. We were debating for months, but the outcome was always the same: \u2018Let the people in.\u2019 And on top of this, in the first few months, for some reason no one was able to say out loud that this is an issue of the utmost importance for Europe. For months it was first regarded as a humanitarian issue, and then as a technical problem as to where the refugees should be settled and how they should be distributed. No one raised the question of whether the essence of the matter is more about our existence, our cultural identity and our way of life. I do not know for certain what is actually happening, and I do not want to blame anyone; but the suspicion arises that none of this is happening by chance. I am not brave enough to publicly talk about this as a certainty; the suspicion inevitably emerges, however, that there is some kind of master plan behind this.\u201d The same elites who\u2019ve weakened, if not destroyed, countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe and elsewhere have done so to the United States itself, and it has all been executed by design, for it\u2019s easier to rule and rob prostrated and confused populations. The master plan is to reduce citizens of whatever nation to disposable cogs that must compete for the lowest wages and be chained to lifelong debts, as dished out by criminal banks. In the United States, farcical elections are held with sustained fanfare to give an increasingly angry populace an illusion of political participation. Whoever is propped up as \u201cPresident,\u201d the military banking complex, Anglo Zionists or American Empire, call them what you will, will continue their rampage worldwide while eviscerating their host nation. Is there an alternative? Orban sees the world as having changed radically since the 2008 financial crisis, and there\u2019s no recovery, in his view. Though guarded in his statements, he\u2019s prepping Hungary for life beyond the collapse of both Washington and the European Union. In the meantime, Orban is straddling East and West. In August of 2014, Hungary was caught sending about 80 T-72 tanks to the Ukraine. Dumped for just $8,500 a piece, it hardly seems worth it to antagonize Russia. The Pentagon has also announced it will send heavy weapons and tanks to Hungary. Perhaps Orban will use these new tanks to retake the TransCarpathian as Ukraine weakens even further. Joining NATO in 1999, Hungary participated in the embargo of Yugoslavia, and for the American wars on Afghanistan and Iraq, it sent 360 then 300 troops, respectively. After aiding the American Empire, Hungary is dodging the consequence by rejecting legitimate refugees. Orban was disingenuous, then, when he claimed, \u201cWe did not destroy the countries from which migrants are coming. We did not bomb anyone. We did not invite anyone here. And now those who dropped the bombs and sent out invitations want to settle them here. Is this fair?\u201d Orban has evolved from a US-groomed prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a critic of Uncle Sam. He has matured. It\u2019s interesting that in all former Communist countries, citizens have rejected any globalist vision, as embraced by the left, to elect nationalist governments. American politicians also speak of defending the nation\u2019s interests, but it\u2019s only so much hot air from jerking puppets. With sane, intelligent voices drown out by incessant garbage, there\u2019s no composure or wisdom in the public discourse. Instead, we get slogans or loutish insults. We dwell in a mad mental universe. In his 2013 Presidential Address, Vladimir Putin stated: \u201cToday, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures. Society is now required not only to recognize everyone\u2019s right to the freedom of consciousness, political views and privacy, but also to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning. This destruction of traditional values from above not only leads to negative consequences for society, but is also essentially anti-democratic, since it is carried out on the basis of abstract, speculative ideas, contrary to the will of the majority, which does not accept the changes occurring or the proposed revision of values. We know that there are more and more people in the world who support our position on defending traditional values that have made up the spiritual and moral foundation of civilization in every nation for thousands of years: the values of traditional families, real human life, including religious life, not just material existence but also spirituality, the values of humanism and global diversity. Of course, this is a conservative position. But speaking in the words of Nikolai Berdyaev, the point of conservatism is not that it prevents movement forward and upward, but that it prevents movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state. In recent years, we have seen how attempts to push supposedly more progressive development models onto other nations actually resulted in regression, barbarity and extensive bloodshed. This happened in many Middle Eastern and North African countries. This dramatic situation unfolded in Syria.\u201d These \u201cprogressive development models\u201d are nothing but dignified cloaks to hide barbaric imperialism. The USSR worked the same way. Having never been subjugated and humiliated, Americans have only dished out, and not experienced, \u201cchaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state,\u201d but the elites that have destroyed so many lives worldwide are also working against us Americans, so a future of terror and degradation will be our lot unless we can muster up the collective will to challenge our criminal overlords. Sniping at each other, there\u2019s no dialogue here, much less unity. It doesn\u2019t look promising. Linh Dinh is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate.

Crucial supply-lines to the north have been cut leaving the Sunni extremists and anti-government militias stranded inside a vast, urban cauldron. It\u2019s only a matter of time before these\u00a0disparate renegades are either killed or forced to surrender. A victory in Aleppo will change the course of the war by restoring government control over the densely-populated western corridor. This is why the Obama administration is frantically searching for ways to either delay or derail the Russian-led juggernaut and avoid the impending collapse of US policy in Syria. Recent peace talks in Geneva were convened with one goal in mind, to prevent Syrian President Bashar al Assad and loyalist forces from retaking Aleppo. The negotiations failed, however, when Washington\u2019s mercurial allies, the so called \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels, refused to participate. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Syrian opposition withdrew \u201cunder pressure from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, two of the main backers of the rebels.\u201d\u00a0 The WSJ\u2019s admission was later confirmed by Secretary of State John Kerry who according to a report in the Middle East Eye \u201cblamed the Syrian opposition for leaving the talks and paving the way for a joint offensive by the Syrian government and Russia on Aleppo.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cBlame the opposition. It was the opposition that didn\u2019t want to negotiate and didn\u2019t want a ceasefire, and they walked away.\u201d None of this will surprise readers who followed the talks closely. The meetings were surrounded by\u00a0confusion from the very onset. The US delegation headed by Kerry was focused entirely on reaching an agreement that would involve a ceasefire and stop the government-led onslaught. The Saudis, Turks and opposition leaders, however, were on a different page altogether. They\u00a0seemed oblivious to the dire situation on the ground where their jihadist foot soldiers were taking heavier losses by the day.\u00a0 Kerry, the realist, was looking for a way to\u00a0stand-down\u00a0and save\u00a0US-backed militants from certain annihilation. But\u00a0the Saudis and Turks felt they had a strong-enough hand to make demands. The clash in viewpoints\u00a0was bound to produce disappointing results, which it did. The meetings were\u00a0cancelled before they even began. Nothing was settled. Here\u2019s more from the WSJ: \u201cAbout a half-dozen cities and towns targeted in the new regime offensives have one thing in common: All were held by a mix of Islamist and moderate rebel groups funded and armed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Complicating the picture is that some, but not all, of these groups collaborate with the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. That gives the regime and its allies fodder for their claim that they are fighting terrorism.\u201d (\u201cSaudi Arabia, Turkey Pushed Syrian Opposition to Leave Talks\u201c, Wall Street Journal) This should dispel any illusion that that the fighters that are trying to topple the government are merely disgruntled nationalists determined to remove an \u201cevil dictator\u201d. That is not the case at all. While there are a fair amount of indigenous insurgents, the bulk of fighters are Sunni extremists bent on removing Assad and creating an Islamic Caliphate. This is why Moscow refused to implement a ceasefire during the talks in Geneva. Russia adamantly opposes any remedy that allows internationally-recognized terrorists from escaping\u00a0their eternal reward. Kerry has deliberately misled the public on this matter. Just last week, he said,\u00a0\u201cRussia has indicated to me very directly they are prepared to do a ceasefire\u2026 The Iranians confirmed in London just a day and a half ago they will support a ceasefire now.\u201d This is false and Kerry knows it. Moscow has tried to be flexible about other so called \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition forces, but when it comes to ISIS,\u00a0 Jabhat Al-Nusra (Syrian Al-Qaeda group), Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen, Harakat Nouriddeen Al-Zinki, and Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham, Russian leaders have repeatedly said that that they will not relent until the\u00a0jihadists are either killed or captured.\u00a0\u00a0 This is why Russia\u2019s airstrikes continued during Geneva, because most of the fighters in Aleppo are dyed-in-the-wool terrorists. It\u2019s worth noting that the Russian-led military offensive clearly\u00a0hews to UN resolution 2254 which states: \u2026\u00a0for Member States to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed  specifically by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Al-Nusra Front (ANF), and all other individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities associated with Al Qaeda or ISIL, and other terrorist groups, [\u2026] and to eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Syria, and notes that the aforementioned ceasefire will not apply to offensive or defensive actions against these individuals, groups, undertakings and entities, as set forth in the 14 November 2015 ISSG Statement.\u201d (Thanks to Moon of Alabama) In other words,\u00a0Moscow is not going to comply with any ceasefire that spares homicidal\u00a0jihadists or undermines UN resolution 2254.\u00a0Russian military operations are going to continue until ISIS, al Nusra and the other\u00a0terrorist militias\u00a0are defeated. Even so, Kerry has not abandoned the diplomatic track. In fact, Kerry plans to meet Russian Foreign Minsiter Sergei Lavrov in Munich on February 11 for a meeting of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) to discuss \u201call the aspects of the Syrian settlement in line with the UN Security Council resolution 2254.\u201d The emergency meeting underscores the Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s utter desperation\u00a0in the face of the inexorable Russian-led military offensive. It\u2019s clear now that Obama and his lieutenants see the handwriting on the wall and realize that their sinister plan to use proxy\u00a0armies to remove Assad and splinter the country into three powerless regions is doomed to fail.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the ISW summed it up on the Sic Semper Tyrannis website: \u201cBattlefield realities rather than great power politics will determine the ultimate terms of a settlement to end the Syrian Civil War. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran have internalized this basic principle even as Washington and other Western capitals pinned their hopes upon UN-sponsored Geneva Talks, which faltered only two days after they began on February 1, 2016. Russian airpower and Iranian manpower have brought President Assad within five miles of completing the encirclement of Aleppo City, the largest urban center in Syria and an opposition stronghold since 2012. \u2026The full encirclement of Aleppo City would fuel a humanitarian catastrophe, shatter opposition morale, fundamentally challenge Turkish strategic ambitions, and deny the opposition its most valuable bargaining chip before the international community.\u201d\u00a0 (\u201cISW recognizes reality in western Syria\u201c, Institute for the Study of War (ISW) Last week\u2019s fighting in northern Aleppo has transformed the battlespace and shifted the momentum in favor of the government, but it has not yet dampened support for the jihadists in places like Ankara or Riyadh. In fact, the Saudis have offered to deploy ground troops to Syria provided they are put under US command. As for Turkey, according to The Hill:\u00a0\u201cMoscow\u2019s Defense Ministry (has) accused Turkey of planning a military invasion of Syria.\u201d Here\u2019s more from\u00a0the same article: \u201cThe Russian Defence Ministry registers a growing number of signs of hidden preparation of the Turkish Armed Forces for active actions on the territory of Syria,\u201d ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement\u2026.Russia claimed\u00a0(to) have \u201creasonable grounds to suspect intensive preparation of Turkey for a military invasion\u201d of Syria.\u201d (The Hill) Turkish officials have denied that\u00a0they\u00a0are preparing for an invasion, but at the same time, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0has\u00a0admitted\u00a0that Turkey will not stay on the sidelines if it is asked to participate in a future campaign. This is from Bloomberg News: \u201cPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country should not repeat in Syria the same mistake it made in Iraq when it turned down a U.S. request to be part of the coalition that toppled Saddam Hussein. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fall into the same mistake in Syria as in Iraq,\u201d the president said, recounting how Turkey\u2019s parliament denied a U.S. request to use its territories for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see the horizon. What\u2019s going on in Syria can only go on for so long. At some point it has to change,\u201d he told journalists on the return flight from a tour of Latin America, according to Hurriyet newspaper.\u201d (\u201cErdogan Signals Turkey Won\u2019t Stay Out of Syria If Asked to Join\u201c, Bloomberg) While it\u2019s impossible to know whether Turkey, Saudi Arabia or the US will actually invade Syria, it\u2019s clear by the panicky reaction to the encirclement of Aleppo, that all three countries feel their regional ambitions are more closely aligned with those of the jihadists than with the elected government in Damascus.\u00a0 This tacit alliance between the militants and their sponsors speaks volumes about the credibility of Washington\u2019s fake war on terror. Finally, in less than five months, loyalist forces aided by heavy Russian air cover, have shifted the balance of power in Syria,\u00a0forced thousands of\u00a0terrorist insurgents to\u00a0flee\u00a0their strongholds in the west, cleared the way for the return of millions of refugees and displaced civilians, and sabotaged\u00a0the malign plan to reshape the country so it better serves\u00a0Washington\u2019s\u00a0geopolitical interests. The war is far from over, but it\u2019s beginning to look like Putin\u2019s gamble\u00a0is going to\u00a0pay off after all. Mike Whitney ives in Washington state.

Iran governor Valiollah Seif\u2019s central bank announced the decision in a television interview on January 29. The change will take effect on March 21, and it will impact all official financial and foreign exchange reports. \u201cIran\u2019s difficulties [in dealing] with the dollar,\u201d Seif said, \u201cwere in place from the time of the primary sanctions and this trend is continuing,\u201d but when it comes to other currencies, he added, \u201cwe face no limitations.\u201d In a piece published by Forbes, Dominic Dudley contends that this move is significant \u201cin the light of the recent\u00a0\u2018Muslim ban\u2018\u201d announced by Trump. Iran nationals were added to the order issued by the current U.S. administration, which prompted the Iranian government to vow to stop issuing visas to U.S. citizens. Dudley notes that since 1975, \u201cno Americans have been killed in terrorist attacks in the US by the citizens of the countries included in the ban,\u201d while countries such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201chome of 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks\u201d \u2014 were left out of the list of prohibited countries. Despite the country\u2019s decision to halt the use of the U.S. dollar as its base currency for exchange with other nations, Iran\u2019s top export is oil. In the global markets, oil is mainly purchased and sold in U.S. dollars. This fiscal year, Iran is expected to earn \u00a0$41 billion from oil sales, with countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China\u00a0as their top clients. It\u2019s still uncertain how the country will manage to switch currencies without relying on the American currency. The shift, Dudley notes, \u201cwill add a degree of currency risk and volatility and is likely to complicate matters for the authorities.\u201d This matters because predominantly Muslim countries left out of the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d include Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s top oil exporters. In the 1970s, the Arab nation struck a deal with U.S. President Richard Nixon establishing an alliance that would maintain the dollar as the standard oil exchange currency in exchange for military support from America. The use of the dollar as a standard currency for oil exchange was accepted by Saudi Arabia and the remaining block of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which include Iran and 11 other Middle Eastern, African, and South American countries. OPEC countries account for 42 percent of global oil production, holding 73 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves. Due to its influence, the use of the U.S. dollar as its standard currency helps to keep demand for the U.S. dollar high, giving the currency the support it requires to remain \u201cthe world\u2019s reserve currency\u201d and preventing the effects of inflation from hitting the U.S. consumer. Iran\u2019s decision to exit this deal might impact the U.S. economy and threaten the dollar, prompting the U.S. government to take stern measures to combat Iran\u2019s actions. After all, Iran holds 13 percent of OPEC\u2019s oil reserves. This article (Iran Just Officially Ditched the Dollar in Major Blow to US: Here\u2019s Why It Matters) is free and open source.

According to a\u00a0USA Today\u00a0investigative report, \u201cboys make up about 36% of children caught up in the U.S. sex industry\u00a0(about 60% are female and less than 5% are transgender males and females).\u201d Consider this:\u00a0every two minutes, a child is exploited in the sex industry. In Georgia alone, it is estimated that\u00a07,200 men (half of them in their 30s) seek to purchase sex with adolescent girls each month, averaging roughly 300 a day. On average, a child might be\u00a0raped by 6,000 men during a five-year period. It is estimated that\u00a0at least 100,000 children\u2014girls and boys\u2014are bought and sold for sex in the U.S. every year, with as many as 300,000 children in danger of being trafficked each year. Some of these children are forcefully abducted, others are runaways, and still others are sold into the system by relatives and acquaintances. Child rape has become Big Business in America. This is an industry that revolves around cheap sex on the fly, with young girls and women who are\u00a0sold to 50 men each day for $25 apiece, while their\u00a0handlers make $150,000 to $200,000 per child\u00a0each year. This is not a problem found only in big cities. It\u2019s happening everywhere, right under our noses, in suburbs, cities and towns across the nation. As Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children points out, \u201cThe only way not to find this in any American city is simply not to look for it.\u201d Don\u2019t fool yourselves into believing that this is merely a concern for lower income communities or immigrants. It\u2019s not. It is estimated that there are\u00a0100,000 to 150,000 under-aged child sex workers in the U.S.\u00a0These girls aren\u2019t volunteering to be sex slaves. They\u2019re being lured\u2014forced\u2014trafficked into it. In most cases, they have no choice. Every transaction is rape. In order to avoid detection (in some cases\u00a0aided and abetted by the police) and cater to male buyers\u2019 demand for sex with different women, pimps and the gangs and crime syndicates they work for have turned sex trafficking into a highly mobile enterprise, with trafficked girls, boys and women constantly being moved from city to city, state to state, and country to country. For instance, the Baltimore-Washington area, referred to as\u00a0The Circuit, with its I-95 corridor dotted with rest stops, bus stations and truck stops, is a hub for the sex trade. No doubt about it: this is a highly profitable, highly organized and highly sophisticated sex trafficking business that operates in towns large and small,\u00a0raking in upwards of $9.5 billion a year in the U.S. alone\u00a0by abducting and selling young girls for sex. Every year, the girls being bought and sold gets younger and younger. The average age of those being trafficked is 13. Yet as the head of a group that combats trafficking pointed out, \u201cLet\u2019s think about what average means. That means there are children younger than 13.\u00a0That means 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds.\u201d \u201cFor every 10 women rescued, there are 50 to 100 more women who are brought in by the traffickers. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not 18- or 20-year-olds anymore,\u201d noted a 25-year-old victim of trafficking. \u201cThey\u2019re minors as young as 13 who are being trafficked.\u00a0They\u2019re little girls.\u201d This is America\u2019s dirty little secret. But what or who is driving this evil appetite for young flesh? Who buys a child for sex? Otherwise ordinary men\u00a0from all walks of life. \u201cThey could be your co-worker, doctor, pastor or spouse,\u201d writes journalist Tim Swarens, who spent more than a year investigating the sex trade in America. Catholic and Protestant churches have been particularly singled out in recent years for harboring these sexual predators. Twenty years after the clergy sex abuse scandal rocked the Catholic Church, hundreds of sexual predators\u2014priests, deacons, monks and lay people\u2014continue to be given work assignments in proximity to children. In many cases, the\u00a0abuse continues unabated. Although much less publicized, the sex crimes within the Protestant Church have been no less egregious. For instance, a recent expose into the Southern Baptist Church leaders by the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u00a0documents over 700 child sex victims \u201cwho were\u00a0molested, sent explicit photos or texts, exposed to pornography, photographed nude, or repeatedly raped by youth pastors. Some victims as young as 3 were molested or raped inside pastors\u2019 studies and Sunday school classrooms.\u201d And then you have national sporting events such as the Super Bowl, where sex traffickers have been caught selling minors,\u00a0some as young as 9 years old. Yet even if the Super Bowl is not exactly a \u201cwindfall\u201d for sex traffickers as some claim, it remains a lucrative source of income for the child sex trafficking industry and a draw for those who are willing to pay to rape young children. According to criminal investigator Marc Chadderdon, these \u201cbuyers\u201d\u2014the so-called \u201cordinary\u201d men who drive the demand for sex with children\u2014represent a cross-section of American society:\u00a0every age, every race, every socio-economic background, cops, teachers, corrections workers, pastors, etc. And then there are the\u00a0extra-ordinary\u00a0men, such as Jeffrey Epstein, the hedge fund billionaire / convicted serial pedophile\u00a0who was arrested on charges of molesting, raping and sex trafficking dozens of young girls, only to die under highly unusual circumstances. It is believed that Epstein operated his own personal sex trafficking ring not only for his personal pleasure but also\u00a0for the pleasure of his friends and business associates. According to\u00a0The Washington Post, \u201cseveral of the young women\u2026say they were\u00a0offered to the rich and famous as sex partners\u00a0at Epstein\u2019s parties.\u201d At various times, Epstein ferried his friends about on his private plane,\u00a0nicknamed the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d Men like Epstein and his cronies, who belong to a\u00a0powerful, wealthy, elite segment of society\u00a0that operates according to their own rules, skate free of accountability by taking advantage of a\u00a0criminal justice system that panders to the powerful, the wealthy and the elite. Still, where did this appetite for young girls come from? Look around you. Young girls have been sexualized for years now in music videos, on billboards, in television ads, and in clothing stores. Marketers have created a demand for young flesh and a ready supply of over-sexualized children. \u201cIn a market that sells high heels for babies and thongs for tweens, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that\u00a0sex, if not porn, has invaded our lives,\u201d\u00a0writes Jessica Bennett for\u00a0Newsweek.\u00a0\u201cWhether we welcome it or not, television brings it into our living rooms and the Web brings it into our bedrooms. According to a 2007 study from the University of Alberta, as many as 90 percent of boys and 70 percent of girls aged 13 to 14 have accessed sexually explicit content at least once.\u201d Read More @ Rutherford.org", "entities": ["Super Bowl XLIV", "San Francisco", "Illegal drug trade", "Sex trafficking in the United States", "USA Today", "United States", "Georgia (U.S. state)", "Orders of magnitude (mass)", "Pareidolia", "Orders of magnitude (numbers)", "Rape", "50 (number)", "Human trafficking in the United States", "Ernie Allen", "National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "100,000", "Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area", "Child", "Thirteenth grade", "Minor (law)", "Journalist", "The Real McCoys", "Southern Baptist Convention", "Houston Chronicle", "Detective", "Mick Stallard", "Jacob Epstein", "Lolita (disambiguation)", "Millennium", "Ageism"], "partisanship": "FarRight", "year": "2020", "model_hero": "<pad> Super Bowl LIV, but the biggest loser will be the hundreds of young girls and boys\u2014some as young as 9 years old\u2014who will be bought and sold for sex during the course of the big game.</s>", "model_hero_score": 0.4435943067073822, "prompt_length_exceeded": true, "model_villain": "<pad> Child sex trafficking, but child rape.</s>", "model_villain_score": 0.3949733376502991, "model_victim": "<pad> America\u2019s fault.</s>", "model_victim_score": 0.29183870553970337, "duration": {"hero": 7.307436466217041, "villain": 2.390469789505005, "victim": 1.1950228214263916}, "hero": "None", "victim": "children, boys, transgender males and females, adolescent girls, child sex workers, sex slaves", "villain": "adults who purchase children, sexual predators, clergy, Jeffrey Epstein"}, {"article_id": "1513859517", "publication_date": "2020-02-06 01:27:10", "headline": "Birmingham dad who opposed LGBT lessons faces jail", "url": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=202049", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "False", "themes": "", "media_id": "31382", "media_name": "thetruthseeker.co.uk", "media_url": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk#spider", "origin_country": "Foreign", "article_text": "by tts-admin | Feb 6, 2020 | 15 comments Concerned parents and their children held protests outside Parkfield Community School (Birmingham) for months. Click to enlarge A Birmingham dad who refused to submit to a school\u2019s controversial and insensitive sexual equality policy is facing jail over his non-compliance. Jabar Hussain, 51, refused to let his son attend school because of a protracted dispute at Parkfield Community School in Alum Rock (Birmingham) over compulsory lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) lessons. Hussain, like many other Muslim parents, refused to allow his child to attend the lessons on religious grounds. The school suspended the so-called equality lessons in March 2019 (officially called the No Outsiders programme) only to re-introduce them in June, a move which infuriated concerned parents. Concerned parents, most of whom are Muslim, have long argued that the programme is a cover for promoting homosexuality and transgenderism. The concerned parents have argued that young children should not be exposed to such contentious issues at a tender age. Mr Hussein faces a hefty fine (to the tune of \u00a32,500) and a potential three-month jail sentence for refusing to let his nine-year-old son attend school, where he would have been exposed to the controversial No Outsiders programme. Mr Hussain is reportedly seeking a judicial review on the grounds that the controversial programme is \u201cincompatible\u201d with his rights and Muslim faith. The judicial review has been proposed on \u201csafeguarding risk\u201d grounds in so far as it allegedly promotes distorted notions of gender identity. The legal case, in addition to broader issues related to the controversial No Outsiders programme, is widely seen as an example of deep communal divisions and religious tensions in Britain. In addition, the school\u2019s and Birmingham City Council\u2019s insistence on implementing the controversial programme against the wishes of concerned parents has given rise to fears that the British establishment is determined to impose its norms and values on ethnic and religious minorities. Protesting parents were further dismayed in March 2019, when the Office for Standards in Education, Children\u2019s Services and Skills (Ofsted \u2013 the government department responsible for inspecting schools) ruled that the No Outsiders programme is \u201cage-appropriate\u201d. Source A brave man, fighting for his beliefs. Where\u2019s the rest of British parents? Where is your Christian zeal in this issue? I suspect totally gone as this rubbish wouldn\u2019t be in our classrooms in the first place. We are doomed, pedo lessons coming soon, i bet!! Jabar Hussain is protesting against this brainwashing campaign. What about English Aboriginals, do they accept this barbarity? Do they believe in \u201csexual orientations\u201d? Soon after the LGBT bull dust even the pedophilia will be legalized . What happens to the\nfreedom to have a dissenting opinion ? and the freedom of free speech ? Should the freedom of the individual be  subservient to the LGBT mambo Jambo ?  Now only the LGBT bull  s\u2026.. is the only opinion permissible and this beg this question about the Judges with who are  aligned the members of \u201d Judicial reviews \u201d ? Should this group be dismantled because no longer serves the needs of the wider community ? Why did the people ever allow or agree to the State taking charge of their children\u2019s education?    Why do people agree to it now?    Why are the Christians and others allowing this incredible abuse of their own children? If this muslim gent and his family can, they should return to their country of origin or a coyntey that does nor mandate this madness as education\u201d. It is better to suffer poverty than to be brought to ones knees obeying the commands of this Satanic ruling cult that insist on corrupting their precious children. As Malcom X said \u201cOnly a fool would let his enemy educate his children\u201d It is not christians or muslims This is all satanic and why we allow \u2026 It is a file and repulsive programme which should be stamped out at its roots,any respectable parent would and should take the same attitude as this man and if necessary mass demonstrations to support their actions against this practice. million Getaneh:  You are correct. People in the West have been given a constant dose of secularism. The same way that you can poison someone, by administrating a slow dose of poison without the persons knowledge, will ultimately lead to dead. That \u201cpoison\u201d of secularism was administrated in the educational system, entertainment, media and publishing and ultimately into the political realm. Even organized Religion has fallen victim to this diabolical scheme, by providing only \u201clip service\u201d, but there hearts are far from it. If a Nation turns its against the Creator, He will turn against that Nation. Divide and conquer lol where is the people power? Thing is it is still here but we are blinded the pit us against each other then they bend us over and lbgt us very hard. Get together over me dumb dumb dumb dumb. Let\u2019s first get our people as one white, black, Asian, Indian, arab, and all other cultures and creeds that\u2019s the only way we can win. Let\u2019s be as one and stop this his black his white his muslim his so and so and work as one unit. If we don\u2019t we have no hope what so ever. The photo above indicates that the only really decent people left in our nations who tend to have children and protect family values are non-whites and mostly Muslim. As a white person in Canada I can see even our separate schools overrun with the LGBT nonsense without a peep from the white parents with 1.2 children per family, and who really do not give a shit about anything but material prosperity and social status. When I look around for stable and straight families I only see a smattering of white Christian ones, in a sea of Sikh, Muslim, and Chinese ethnic communities which are thriving with family normalcy, children and prosperity \u2013 unless they are second and third generation types who have been brainwashed by the secular social engineering through our corrupt media and educational systems. Party politics is the tool to devide specially if the parties are all United under one banner. Henry h ..Where\u2019s the rest of British parents?\nThe answer is, they are part of the LGBTQRXYZ association \u2026. Believe it or not, our masters tested the water with the smoking ban. It was about control and public reaction. They were testing how the public would behave when you took away a basic right of them, by banning smoking in public places and of course, backed up your views with health scares. They found that overall, the public weren\u2019t that bothered, especially after being brainwashed with the \u2018passive smoking causes cancer\u2019 BS. And voila, 20+ years later and they\u2019re enforcing sodomy to be taught into schools and no one\u2019s really complaining. After all, they\u2019ve all got used to the sodomite brigade on the TV, from the Liberaches, to the John Inmans, the Larry Graysons to the Kenny Everets, the Freddie Mercurys to the Boy Georges and literally every second individual, on the TV and radio being a raging queen. So, obviously they accept the globohomo reality that now is. Just like Juden, the homosexuals, a tiny minority now have the upper hand, essentially now first class citizens, above everyone else who now are second class, the heterosexuals I believe they\u2019re called. Next step, arresting fathers who beat up paedophiles, who\u2019ve been trying to nonse their children. The psychologists are already promoting the \u201cthey were born that way\u201d just as they did with the homosexuals. I stated when I started blogging the simple truth \u2013 \u201cwhen you allow one taboo into society, you have no moral high ground into condemning the others\u201d. Pandora\u2019s box was opened and now we have the hell that\u2019s coming to face because of it.\nIt takes a Muslim, an immigrant to speak out against wrong in western society. This shows how pathetic it now is.\nHowever, that stated, the Muslims will get the last laugh. The homosexuals may currently be laughing but not in the future. Roll on 2030 and the Muslim population, completely anti indigenous and homosexual will be forcing their way of life on the rest. Roll on 2040 and it will have grown even more. Roll on 2050 and 2060 and they\u2019ll be winning lots of local elections, voting as a tribal block. And in will come an Islamic, Sharia party, instantly disbanding the House of Lords, the monarchy (good riddance I say) and ending all democracy every again (not that there ever was) and implementing the Muslim state, under the will of Allah. The homosexual men will be hanged. The homosexual women will be given a choice \u2013 pump out babies or join their male counterparts. Islamisation of the UK will certainly happen by 2060, very probably before. You won\u2019t see any sodomites laughing then, I can assure you of that.\nThis article shows one thing really and one thing only \u2013 the indigenous of the UK, don\u2019t deserve survival. Any country that allows sodomy, to be promoted in schools and to young children as natural, normal and moral behaviour, doesn\u2019t deserve to exist sadly. They hate and demonize islam because it is against everything they do or believe in. For example isis, al Qaeda, and daesh they are not muslim they kill muslims every day, they bomb mosques these are the enemies who pretend to be muslim but are in fact an army put there to demonize and kill muslims. We believe that every human being is born muslim first. Born innocent islam will be the last stand against these people they fear it. Christianity has been hijacked I mean they have made a film in the film jesus is gay why do the Christian\u2019s allow this? Wheres the love? indigenous, ie, white and / or Christian brits are charged with \u2018hate crime\u2019 laws whenever they object to novel indoctrination methods. The only reason this protest got as far as it did was because of the large concentration of muslims in the area.  In other regions, individual parents complaining have been reported to the local social services department for \u2018abusing\u2019 their children by teaching them to be hateful, and they have had to suffer the threat or reality of losing custody of their children to the state. In Germany home schooling has effectively been criminalised. Our courts do not approve of us anymore when it comes to \u2018hate crimes\u2019; we are all guilty until we can complete the impossible task of disproving a null hypothesis, with the harshest punishments considered just reward.  Hate laws do not care for the intent of the accused, only the \u2018feelings\u2019 of those crying \u201cI am offended by your hatefulness\u201d.   In some opinions, we have a two-tier justice system where the more traditional brits are automatically fascist, racist Nazis who are presumed highly likely to become violent or incite violence in others. This is (was) the globalist plan for the world \u2013 no more straight whites or Christians: everyone else gets a free pass.

Biden also ended the Migrant Protection Program which effectively ended the Obama-Biden era catch-and-release policies regarding migrants illegally entering the U.S. \u201cWe already have planes in the air, boots on the ground, boats on the water, and cruisers on the roads,\u201d the Texas governor said, referring to the state\u2019s efforts. \u201cWe must expand our efforts to crack down on human trafficking and drug smuggling in Texas.\u201d Texas legislators called for spending nearly $800 million on border security efforts over the next two years, the\u00a0Austin American-Statesman\u00a0reported. The proposed $797 million budget is a reduction of $3.5 million from the previous biennium. Over the past three legislative sessions, Texas hired approximately 1,000 more Department of Public Safety troopers to help support efforts along the state\u2019s southern border with Mexico. The state also built technology and training centers. National Guardsmen and airmen also participated in the Texas border security efforts.

He planted an American flag in 1846 into the city\u2019s soil to claim the land for the United States. A website that catalogs \u201cinteresting\u201d locations around the world wrote about the controversy: In the 1980s, San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery had the city commission a statue of Fallon raising the U.S. flag in San Jose at a cost of over $800,000. The statue was completed in 1988, and was scheduled to be located in the City Park Plaza (now known as Plaza de C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez) near the site of the flag raising. However local groups, including Hispanic Americans, protested that Fallon represented American imperialism and repression of the Mexican population. The statue was stored until 2002, when it was finally displayed in a small park northwest of the original proposed location, near Julian and St. James Streets.\u201d A now, even the more low-key location is being challenged, according to the San Francisco Chronicle report on public meetings held on the statue\u2019s fate: Community members used their 1-minute allotted time to persuade city officials to get rid of the controversial 16-foot-tall statue, many using the same words to describe Fallon\u2019s legacy: Colonialism. Imperialism. Racism. Injustice. White supremacy. Violence. Genocide. Fallon was one of the \u201csoldiers of John C. Fremont\u2019s brigade that was involved in the war with Mexico\u201d from 1846 to 1848, and he went on to serve one yearlong term as San Jose\u2019s 10th mayor, said Albert Camarillo, a Stanford University American history professor and historian. Some speakers suggested melting the bronze and commissioning local artists to repurpose the metal in a new statue more representative of San Jose\u2019s influential leaders of color. Some suggested moving the statue to a museum or local historical society where context could be given, and others proposed allowing Latino, indigenous and Black people to remove the statue. \u201cAs an immigrant, it makes me feel extremely unwanted and unwelcome,\u201d local high school student Valentina Coronel said in the Chronicle report, adding \u201cwe have basically destroyed the Native American, the Hispanic culture in the whole county. I see the remnants of the culture being erased quickly.\u201d \u201cEach time I see that, that\u2019s what I see: It\u2019s another example of colonization,\u201d Yolanda Guerra, a teacher at San Jose High School who lives in the neighborhood where the statue stands, said. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, who solicited evidence of Fallon\u2019s misdeeds, said it would cost about $400,000 to remove the statue and transport it elsewhere. Liccardo said in the Chronicle report: It\u2019s clear that many people strongly feel that Fallon has committed these horrible crimes. It would be helpful for us to have that record, and then we will have a very clear basis for saying \u2018let\u2019s move the statue.\u2019 In the meantime, I\u2019ll continue to listen to the community and be very open to the public process that results. The Chronicle reported: The statue is a \u2018permanent\u2019 piece of public art, so it has to go through a de-accession review process, which involves communicating with the artist and move through the Public Art Committee and Arts Commission, which can recommend the removal to the City Council. The City Council has that ultimate authority to de-accession a permanent artwork like the Fallon Statue, said Michael Ogilvie, San Jose\u2019s public art director. Camarillo told the Chronicle that to some Mexican Americans \u201cand to anyone that has a historical consciousness,\u201d the statue is seen as \u201cputting someone who is the manifestation of the worst elements of Manifest Destiny.\u201d \u201cIf it causes injury to some subset of a population in the public realm \u2014 Mexican Americans, Latinos constitute the largest minority in San Jose \u2014 if a subset of that population feels harmed, affected by that statue, which does what?\u201d Camarillo said, adding it \u201cshows that the United States was taken, that Mexican California was taken by a violent overthrow of the American Republic in 1846. This fellow (Fallon) represents that.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com PoliticsSocial JusticeAmerican FlagcolonialismManifest DestinyMexican-American WarracismSan JoseStatueThomas Fallon .

Who needs him? Not House of Cards, it turns out, as Netflix announced it is carrying on with production of the series without its now disgraced, former star. Spacey, who played President Frank Underwood on the hit show, was dropped from the series after numerous men came forward with allegations of sexual abuse and harassment including out gay actor Anthony Rapp. Rapp alleged Spacey tried to take advantage of him when he was just 14. Spacey then tried to deflect the issue by coming out as gay himself. The series has tapped Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear to take over as co-stars of the drama, likely hoping the big names can distract from the absence of its lead. Production resumed on Tuesday after a three-month hiatus, and Netflix announced the additions of Lane and Kinnear, who will play brother and sister, today. The show\u2019s co-star,\u00a0Robin Wright, who plays Claire Underwood, will also reportedly play a central role in this, the sixth and final season. It is expected to be released later this year, and will be eight episodes long, down from the usual 13, reports The New York Times. While the show\u2019s ratings have dipped in recent years, it is still considered one of Netflix\u2019s flagship shows, earning it numerous award nominations and wins. The retooling of the show will keep the company from having to pull the plug entirely, like it did with a planned original movie about Gore Vidal that was to star Spacey as the writer, and a Louis CK stand-up special. CK has also had his projects cancelled due to allegations of sexual misconduct. The moves have cost Netflix\u00a0$39 million\u00a0that David Wells, its chief financial officer, said was related to the \u201cthe societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Stay tuned to find out how they navigate Frank Underwood\u2019s sudden disappearance. \u201cI feel like this moment is way bigger than me.\u201d \u201cWhat this ACTUALLY tells me is how safe students feel in your classroom.\u201d \u201cSorry I don\u2019t have razr phone pics to prove it to you,\u201d the rapper joked. When a group of demonstrators protested his show in Boston, one hot Christian got the gay rapper\u2019s attention. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author didn\u2019t like the end result, so he started over. Now \u201cLess Is Lost\u201d is garnering rave reviews without resorting to queer tropes. Who really made the world a better place? Where does our queerness come from? Our bones, lemonade, trains, rainbows?

Kylie Minogue has dropped the music video for her new single \u201cDancing.\u201d The song is the debut single from her new album \u201cGolden,\u201d which comes out on April 6. In the video, Minogue, 49, wears cowboy boots and sparkly Western-inspired outfits. She strums her guitar, also adorned with glitter, and partakes in some line dancing for the pop-country track. Minogue told Chris Evans at BBC Radio 2 that she was \u201cfragile\u201d working on the album, a possible reference to her recent breakup with\u00a0Joshua Sasse, and says she took inspiration from Nashville. \u201cIt was a really good time to be honest and work through everything, and give a snapshot of where I am in my life\u2026. A lot of it was done in Nashville, and that taught me about putting more story into the song\u2026. And then you can take that song and produce that any way you want,\u201d Minogue says.

The Middle Eastern country where Islam is the state religion will welcome soccer players, coaches and fans from all around the planet, beginning Nov. 20, for matches that will pit nation against nation. Qatar has promised to welcome LGBTQ foreigners, even as its own people are tortured and put to death for being who they are. On Monday, Qatar\u2019s ambassador to Germany got an earful from one of those men at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, according to a report by the Associated Press. Fan representative Dario Minden spoke in English directly to Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani, about who he is and who he loves, Minden told him to \u201cabolish the death penalty\u201d for homosexuality. \u201cI\u2019m a man and I love men. I do \u2014 please don\u2019t be shocked \u2014 have sex with other men. This is normal,\u201d Minden told Al Thani. \u201cSo, please get used to it, or stay out of football. Because the most important rule in football is, football is for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re lesbian, if you\u2019re gay. It\u2019s for everyone. For the boys. For the girls. And for everyone in between. \u201cSo, abolish the death penalty. Abolish all of the penalties regarding sexual and gender identity,\u201d he said. A representative of Germany's association of fan and ultra groups went on stage to speak to the DFB's conference on human rights in Qatar ahead of the World Cup.Here's his personal speech on LGBT rights in the country, addressed directly at Qatar's ambassador to Germany. pic.twitter.com/ODYZrsYWyq  Although organizers promised Al Thani an opportunity to respond, the Associated Press reports that portion of the conference was closed to the public and the news media and was not televised. Earlier, Al Thani reportedly complained to those assembled that the issue of human rights was a distraction from the World Cup, even though the event was titled, \u201cSport and Human Rights.\u201d \u201cWe all care about human rights,\u201d said Al Thani. \u201cBut I would have enjoyed (it) more if I saw some concentration not only on just one subject, but the enjoyment of football and the football effect on people around the world.\u201d More than 5,000 miles away in San Francisco, a gay Qatari physician has organized a petition to tell the land of his birth: Love Is Not A Crime. Doctor Nasser Mohamed decided to come out in 2010 following a visit to the U.S., and spent his residency in Connecticut before moving to California in 2015. Mohamed wrote in an op-ed published by Outsports last month that he has spent the last decade caring for the LGBTQ community in outpatient settings and growing as an activist. \u201cBeing an LGBT person is a criminal offense in the legal system in Qatarm as is sex between two men. There are state-sponsored conversion-therapy practices, and LGBT-affirming psychotherapy is not offered.\u201d He wrote how law enforcement uses media and chat rooms to find, jail and punish people for being LGBTQ. \u201cVisibility of the local LGBT community in Qatar, and the exposure of their treatment, are absolutely essential,\u201d Mohamed wrote. \u201cI am doing my part by speaking up.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: Find out about Mohamed\u2019s petition by clicking here. He is also raising money through a GoFundMe account to provide him with funding for his activism as well as security and protection.

The latest is a clampdown on what it sees as \u00e2\u0080\u009clove jihad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the belief that Muslims are seeking to deceive Hindu women through marriage and convert them to Islam. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Putting a price on women's unpaid work in India\u00c2 Over the course of the past year or so,\u00c2\u00a0several BJP politicians have suggested that this is part of an Islamic conspiracy to increase India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Muslim population. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Coronavirus widens the\u00c2\u00a0Hindu-Muslim divide in India\u00c2 More recently, one of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most populous states has assumed the right to intervene in matters of marriage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly between a Hindu woman and a Muslim man. Other states are planning to follow suit. As a political scientist, I see the rapid growth of religious tensions/conflicts in India as a continuation of BJP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-Muslim policies. Despite being a Hindu-majority country, India is home to nearly 200 million Muslims.

In 2019, the Indian government also passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which eases the pathway to citizenship for a range of religious groups from India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighboring countries but excludes Muslims. Related:\u00c2\u00a0India's citizenship\u00c2\u00a0act tied to complex history of nation-building Now, in its latest move, India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, where about a fifth of the population is Muslim and the state government is led by the BJP, has taken to policing the private lives of its citizens. In November, the state passed the first \u00e2\u0080\u009clove jihad\u00e2\u0080\u009d law in the country. Known as the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, it requires couples from different religious communities to provide two months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notice to a district magistrate before getting married. A district magistrate officially belongs\u00c2\u00a0to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administrative services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a vestige of the British colonial rule \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who is in charge of the district, the basic unit of administration, and has legal as well as significant executive powers. Under the terms of the ordinance, the presiding judicial official would have the discretion to decide whether the conversion was through compulsion; the offending person could then be denied bail and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The irony of this issue is that few individuals routinely choose to marry outside their religious affiliation. Notionally, this law applies with equal force to all interfaith marriages. However, for all practical purposes this would affect Muslims, as Islamic personal law requires a non-Muslim to convert to sanctify the marriage. So far, enforcement has targeted only Hindu-Muslim marriages. Since its passage last year, as many as 30 Muslim men arrested in Uttar Pradesh are facing possible prosecution. It remains unclear at this stage what sanctions Muslim women marrying Hindu men might confront. Related:\u00c2\u00a0Durga Vahini women take up arms to protect\u00c2\u00a0Hindu\u00c2\u00a0identity Following the lead of Uttar Pradesh, four other BJP-ruled states are introducing similar legislation. In late December, the central state of Madhya Pradesh passed the Freedom of Religion Bill, which would also place similar restrictions on interreligious marriage. This law also holds the possibility of 10 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 imprisonment. Since the BJP holds a majority in the state legislature, there is a strong possibility of this becoming a law. Thus far there has not been any effort to enact a national law. Currently, the BJP rules in 16 out of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 29 states, and several other states are said to be considering enacting such a law. The strong opposition to any kind of conversion goes back to British India. In the 1920s, a Hindu revivalist movement known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cshuddhi\u00e2\u0080\u009d emerged. It sought to reconvert those who had chosen to embrace other faiths, most notably Islam. At the time, interfaith marriages were a rarity. The movement had a strongly patriarchal tenor and portrayed Hindu women as hapless victims of the ruses of Muslim men. This movement, while it initially acquired a degree of support, faded out as other more compelling social and political issues, such as anti-colonial nationalism, came to the fore. A somewhat similar fervor, I argue, has now returned in independent India. Apart from this legislative onslaught, two other recent incidents, in particular, bear particular mention. The first involved a TV\u00c2\u00a0advertisement for a high-end jewelry chain that was launched on Indian TV\u00c2\u00a0in October. The advertisement was from Tanishq, an affiliate of one of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest conglomerates, the Tata Group, and was titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cEkatvam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnity\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Hindi. The advertisement depicted a Hindu woman and a Muslim man preparing for a wedding. As soon as the advertisements were aired, some Hindu activists protested vigorously on social media. The company, fearing violence, withdrew the advertisement altogether. The other episode took place in November when Netflix aired BBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptation of the novel \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Suitable Boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the acclaimed Indian writer Vikram Seth.

The activists claimed that the film was \u00e2\u0080\u009cencouraging love jihad\u00e2\u0080\u009d and had \u00e2\u0080\u009churt religious sentiments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Accordingly, they demanded that it be forthrightly withdrawn. A minister in the state of Madhya Pradesh lodged a formal police complaint against the showing of the film, and further investigations are on. Urban couples in India are increasingly stepping out from the tradition of arranged marriages and choosing their own life partners, sometimes across religious lines. No previous government has sought to regulate such choices. However, under the Modi government, right-wing Hindu groups are harassing such couples. Related:\u00c2\u00a0In India, WhatsApp is a weapon of antisocial hatred\u00c2 Activists have spoken out vigorously against this tide of vigilantism, and some regional courts have questioned the very basis of a law that encroaches on individual freedoms.

If you would like to receive Morning Brief in your inbox every weekday, please sign up here. Myanmar Coup Puts Halt to Democratic Transition Myanmar\u2019s military has seized control of the country and detained several leaders of the democratically elected National League for Democracy party (NLD)\u2014including the country\u2019s de facto president Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup began with mass arrests in the early hours of Monday morning, on the same day lawmakers were to take their seats in parliament for the opening session following November\u2019s election. A statement read later on military-run television, signed by Vice President Myint Swe, said control of \u201clegislation, administration and judiciary\u201d was now in the hands of General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military, for the next 12 months. That election had been the subject of increased tension between the military\u2014who still controlled key state ministries as well as holding a quarter of seats in parliament\u2014and the NLD. Without evidence, military leaders have alleged massive voting irregularities\u201410 million cases of voter fraud\u2014and demanded voter lists be released by the country\u2019s election commission for analysis. A complicated landslide. November\u2019s vote saw the NLD win a landslide victory, increasing their overall majority in parliament. Although international observers did not point to widespread fraud, the election was criticized for disenfranchising Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minorities: Virtually all Rohingya are barred from voting and voting was canceled in Rakhine state, home to both Rohingya and the Buddhist Rakhine minority. Fears of a coup were driven to high point in recent days after Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, in a speech published in the military-run Myawaddy newspaper, warned it may be\u00a0\u201cnecessary to revoke the constitution\u201d in certain circumstances. Pressure on Biden. Those circumstances arriving not only put the future of Myanmar\u2019s democracy movement in question, but add another pressing issue for a Biden administration eager to reorient U.S. policy toward Asia. In a foreshadowing of possible sanctions, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that the United States \u201cwill take action against those responsible,\u201d if the military\u2019s moves are not soon reversed.

What We\u2019re Following Today Navalny protests erupt again. Protests in support of jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny continued on Sunday, as more than 5,000 protesters were arrested across the country. Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny\u2019s wife, was one of those detained by police, although she was later released. The Sunday protests, if they begin to follow the same pattern as Belarus, could end up a carefully managed sideshow for Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Alexander Gabuev writes in Foreign Policy, a few street protests will not be enough to dislodge the Russian leader.\u00a0\u201cIt is very hard to see how weekly protests \u2026 will somehow force a regime willing to poison a prominent opposition leader with a deadly nerve agent to simply let Navalny go free,\u201d he writes. EU U-turn. European Union officials have admitted to making a \u201cblunder\u201d after the European Commission invoked emergency powers on Friday to impose trade restrictions across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland\u2014effectively undermining their longstanding opposition to a hard border on the island during years of Brexit negotiations and uniting British and Irish leaders in anger. The decision, soon reversed, was made as part of the EU\u2019s imposition of export controls, still in place, on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc. The World Health Organization\u2019s vice-head Mariangela Simao has criticized the move as part of \u201ca very worrying trend.\u201d Modi speaks on farmer protests. Ahead of today\u2019s budget announcement, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the actions of some protesters during last week\u2019s farmer protests in New Delhi an \u201cinsult\u201d to India\u2019s flag\u2014his first public comments after months of farmer unrest. His comments came after protesters raised the Sikh religious flag as well as a farmer\u2019s union flag alongside India\u2019s tricolor after they had stormed the historic Red Fort on India\u2019s national holiday. Modi, speaking in his monthly radio address, added that his government is \u201ccommitted to modernizing agriculture and is also taking many steps in that direction.\u201d Keep an Eye On Taiwan tensions. Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry announced that six Chinese fighter aircraft had entered its air identification zone on Sunday, along with one U.S. reconnaissance aircraft\u2014a rare admission of U.S. activity around the island. Taiwanese officials said that both countries\u2019 aircraft had flown inside the south-western corner of its declared zone. \u00a0The increased aerial traffic comes as Chinese forces are reported to have simulated missiles strikes on a nearby U.S. aircraft carrier as part of a military exercise days after Biden\u2019s inauguration. Central African Republic\u2019s refugee exodus. Over 200,000 people have fled the Central African Republic since violence erupted following a disputed presidential election on Dec. 27, the United Nations refugee agency has reported.

Odds and Ends Scandinavia\u2019s largest film festival is reflecting upon the coronavirus pandemic and themes of social isolation by giving one movie buff the chance to watch the festival\u2019s offerings alone for a week on a desolate island. Lisa Enroth, an emergency nurse, was selected among thousands of volunteers to experience \u201cThe Isolated Cinema\u201d that organizers have set up at the top of a lighthouse on the island of Hamneskar in western Sweden. The unusual treatment is part of artistic director Jonas Holmberg\u2019s vision for the festival, where he hopes to highlight how the pandemic has changed a viewer\u2019s relationship with film. Movies will still be shown at the festival\u2019s traditional home\u2014the 700-seat Draken cinema in Goteborg\u2014although only one ticket, drawn by lottery, is available for each screening.

A proper understanding is a prerequisite for properly forming people in the truth and properly ministering to people in need. As new gender ideologies are promoted throughout America, their lies will impact not only those who suffer from gender dysphoria, but all children who need to mature in their self-understanding as a boy or girl, man or woman, a potential husband or wife, father or mother. In 2007, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital \u201cbecame the first major program in the United States to focus on transgender children and adolescents,\u201d as its website brags. A decade later, more than 45 pediatric gender clinics have opened their doors to our nation\u2019s children. Parents are told that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones may be the only way to prevent their children from committing suicide. Never mind that the best studies of gender dysphoria show that between 80 and 95 percent of children who express a discordant gender identity will come to identify with their bodily sex if natural development is allowed to proceed. Never mind that \u201ctransitioning\u201d treatment has not been shown to reduce the extraordinarily high rate of suicide attempts among people who identify as transgender (41 percent, compared with 4.6 percent of the general population). Never mind that people who have had transition surgery are 19 times more likely to die by suicide. These statistics should be enough to halt the headlong rush into \u201ctransitioning\u201d and prompt us to find more effective ways to prevent these tragic outcomes. Most of all, we shouldn\u2019t be encouraging children to \u201ctransition,\u201d or making heroes and role models of those who have done so. We should be tolerant\u2014indeed, loving\u2014toward those who struggle with their gender identity, but also be aware of the harm done to the common good, particularly to children, when transgender identity is normalized. Transgender activists are not merely asking for tolerance or kindness. They are demanding affirmation, not just from adults but from children and adolescents who are already challenged by the normal process of sexual development. In a culture where transgender identities are not only affirmed but celebrated, everyone will be compelled to construct their own gender identity, unaided by a common understanding of sex differences and why they matter.  In my new book \u201cWhen Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,\u201d I show that the best biology, psychology, and philosophy all support an understanding of sex as a bodily reality, and an understanding of gender as a social manifestation of bodily sex. Biology isn\u2019t bigotry. A sound understanding of gender rejects sex stereotypes on the one hand and androgyny on the other. The virtuous mean is a view of gender that reveals meaningful sex differences and communicates the difference they make\u2014a view that takes sex differences seriously while upholding the fundamental equality of the sexes as complements to one another. The most helpful therapies do not try to remake the body to conform with thoughts and feelings\u2014which is impossible\u2014but rather to help people find healthy ways to manage their tension and move toward accepting the reality of their bodily selves. My book provides a nuanced view of our sexed embodiment, a balanced approach to policy issues involving transgender identity and gender more broadly, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong.

The chart-topping singer arrived in the capital Dakar where she on Friday will join the Global Partnership for Education talks co-hosted by Senegalese President Macky Sall and French leader Emmanuel Macron. Rihanna, the fourth most followed person on Twitter with 86 million followers, took to social media to urge Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to ensure specific funding levels. In her tweet to Macron, Rihanna -- who met with him in Paris in July -- thanked the French leader for leading the conference but pressed him to commit firmly to 250 million euros ($313 million) for the effort. Speaking to Turnbull, she urged funding as part of Australia's entry onto the UN Human Rights Council. Some 264 million school-age children and youths are living without any education owing to poverty, conflict and social barriers including bias against girls, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. The Dakar conference, which brings together governments and the private sector, aims to raise $3.1 billion over the coming three years to support education for 870 million children. The conference in turn asks partner countries to devote 20 percent of public expenditure to education -- a level that can be particularly difficult for countries battling jihadists or civil conflicts. Rihanna, who serves as an ambassador for the Global Partnership for Education, will meet in Dakar with government officials as well as educators and students, representatives said. She has frequently been active in pressing for development funding as part of Global Citizen, the anti-poverty campaign that includes policy events and concerts in New York and a growing number of other cities. The Barbados-born singer -- whose hits include \"Diamonds\" and \"Only Girl (In the World\") -- has also set up the non-profit Clara Lionel Foundation, which includes a scholarship fund for students to learn at US universities. With her Twitter account, she has repeatedly approached leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to raise development issues.

Vicari warns. The statement was made in the context of recent discussion about the status of the all-Republican freeholder board\u2019s federal lawsuit against the \u201cImmigrant Trust Directive,\u201d established by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal. The executive order, which went into effect in March 2019,\u00a0restricts routine cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Elected officials in Ocean County, perhaps the most politically conservative in the state, vehemently oppose the state-imposed directive\u00a0and the county government has\u00a0filed a federal lawsuit against Grewal in an effort to stop it. \u201cYou know, this goes back to not only the Constitution, but also to the Civil War when we said, \u2018who\u2019s going to run the country? Is it going to be state\u2019s rights or a strong national government?\u2019\u201d Vicari asked in public remarks he made during\u00a0an agenda session of the board on Wednesday. \u201cAnd it was decided at that time that we would have a strong national government. &mldr We have 50 states, so each one is going to make different laws. And then what\u2019s going to happen? It\u2019s going to destroy the union and that\u2019s why we had a Civil War. &mldr Our stand is clear and as it should be: There\u2019re no areas of gray.\u201d In December, the state filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Trenton to dismiss\u00a0Ocean County\u2019s complaint, as well as a similar lawsuit\u00a0brought by Cape May County. The\u00a0federal court has\u00a0combined the matters in\u00a0a single docket. On Jan. 21, both counties filed briefs in opposition to\u00a0the state's motion to dismiss. The next day,\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d in support of the counties. The National Sheriffs\u2019 Association also has filed an amicus brief that\u00a0backs\u00a0the legal arguments of the counties, said Freeholder Jack Kelly, director of law and public safety for Ocean County. On the other side of the legal argument, the American Civil Liberties Union has filed an amicus brief in support of the state of New Jersey, Kelly noted. [ The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. ] Vicari said the county government\u00a0was grateful for the federal government\u2019s support. \u201cWe pander to no one except the U.S. Constitution and to the people of Ocean County, because we do the right thing,\u201d Vicari said. In a prepared statement released on Jan. 25, Grewal said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed that the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Justice\u00a0and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d had filed the legal challenge,\u00a0more than one year after he issued the directive. \u201cAt a time when we need to be building bridges with our immigrant communities, the federal government is working to push them further into the shadows,\u201d Grewal said. Freeholder Gerry P. Little pointed out at the board meeting Wednesday that the oath of office freeholders take upon the start of their terms is foremost an oath to support the U.S.\u00a0Constitution. \u201cSo, what the state government has attempted to do is ask us to violate our oath of office, not to obey the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Little said. Little said the directive\u00a0has put\u00a0state, county and local law enforcement officers in\u00a0\u201ca quandary;\u201d forced to decide whether to uphold their oaths to the U.S. Constitution or adhere to an executive fiat from the New Jersey attorney general. \u201cThey\u2019ve done the same thing with many other laws, such as (pertaining to) certain chemical substances and a lot of other issues,\u201d Little said. More: NJ economy: Immigrant impact on Garden State economy ranks No. 3 in the country More: Bruce Springsteen helps draw attention to 'horrific' conditions on Mexico-U.S. border Kelly cautioned his fellow freeholders against overconfidence in the case, explaining that a legal victory was far from assured. \u201cThere is a weakness that we have, there is a weakness\u201d Kelly explained. \u201cWe are an entity of state government and we are under their purview ...\u00a0though\u00a0there are exceptions to that rule.\u201d \u201cStates are entities of the United States,\u201d Little shot back. \u201cI agree,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of court decisions that make you shake your head. So, we\u2019ll have to see where it goes. I believe we should be, and we will be successful in our case.\u201d The Immigrant Trust Directive \u2014 which carries the weight of law \u2014 prohibits\u00a0local, county and state law enforcement officers from stopping, searching or detaining immigrants at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There are exceptions for cases of serious or violent crimes, or in the event a final deportation order is issued by a U.S. immigration court. The directive is intended to build\u00a0trust and improve cooperation between communities of immigrants and police in New Jersey, but it\u2019s also meant to be\u00a0a public rebuke of President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial policies and rhetoric on illegal immigration. [ Stay updated on breaking news at the Jersey Shore with a digital subscription to the Asbury Park Press. While you\u2019re at it, download our app, too. ] In Toms River, the directive has forced\u00a0Ocean County Jail officials to reduce their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, rather than face potential prosecution by Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s\u00a0administration. The policy has incensed Kelly and other Ocean freeholders, who operate and fund the jail with county taxpayer money. The freeholder board\u00a0presides over a county where Trump won almost 65 percent of the vote in 2016, or 179,079 votes out of\u00a0the 276,725\u00a0cast. The county delivered more votes for Trump than any other in New Jersey, even though Hillary Clinton ultimately won the state\u2019s 14 electoral votes. \u201cIf this goes (against us) and each state has a right to pick and choose (which laws to obey) &mldr then what\u2019s next?\u201d Vicari asked. \u201cThe Bill of Rights? You have 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights in the United States. What\u2019s next? The First Amendment? The Second Amendment?\u201d \u201cWell, tell me that\u2019s not under attack,\u201d Kelly replied. \u201cEverything\u2019s under attack,\u201d Vicari said. Freeholder Virginia E. Haines said the First and Second Amendments \u201care always under attack.\u201d Kelly agreed. \u201cThe Constitution is constantly under attack and we\u2019ve got to constantly be vigilant in defending the Constitution of the United States and we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole board took a courageous step last year as the first county in the state of New Jersey to file (a legal challenge against the directive) and then we were joined by Cape May County.\u201d Ocean County General Counsel John C. Sahradnik said the crux of their legal argument\u00a0is that immigration law is the exclusive domain of the federal government and, therefore, state government\u00a0has\u00a0no authority to interfere in the enforcement of such law. New Jersey\u2019s motion to dimiss the case is based on an\u00a0argument\u00a0that Ocean and Cape May counties\u00a0are mere political subdivisions of New Jersey, not autonomous\u00a0administrative regions\u00a0independent of\u00a0state government. Therefore, its 21 counties have no legal standing to sue the state government that established them.\u00a0Moreover, the motion asserts that the attorney general\u2019s directive is not in violation of federal law and is constitutional within the framework\u00a0of New Jersey\u2019s\u00a0sovereignty as a state. Lastly, the state has invoked the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 11th\u00a0Amendment \u2014 which protects New Jersey from being sued in federal court, according to a summary of the arguments provided to the freeholder board last week. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s efforts to coerce states into implementing its immigration agenda have failed repeatedly in the past, and we\u2019ll respond to their latest efforts in court at the appropriate time,\u201d Grewal said.

By twisting the historic meaning of the word \"sex\" in the Title IX education amendment of 1972 to include something other than biological \"male or female,\" Biden has created a monster! Under this socially-radical and disturbing Democrat decree, any educational institution that receives federal funding must now admit biologically-male athletes to women's teams, compete for women's scholarships, share locker rooms and other biologically-separated spaces, including forcing female members of our military to shower with biological men. Alliance Defending Freedom legal counsel Christiana Holcomb wrote that this reckless action will \"gut legal protections for women by denying female athletes fair competition in sports, ignoring women's unique health needs, and forcing vulnerable girls to share intimate spaces with men who identify as female.\" Parsing the consequences as simply as possible author Ryan Anderson explained: \"Boys who identify as girls must be allowed to compete in the girls' athletic competitions, men who identify as women must be allowed in women-only spaces, health care plans must pay for gender transition procedures and doctors and hospitals must perform them.\" Emilie Kao, an attorney with the Heritage Foundation, says America's new 46th president\u2014despite all his talk about \"unity\"\u2014has shown he is \"committed to advancing a radically divisive transgender agenda and has set women back decades.\" There is nothing \"equal\" in pitting biological boys against biological girls. The lunacy of this extreme, \"progressive\" political policy denies acknowledged reality from all of human history and \"established science\" that only two sexes\u2014male and female\u2014exist in the human race\" (Matt. 19:3; Gen. 1:27, 5:2)\u2014one or the other, not both. Chromosomes don't lie, nor are they confused. These gendered individuals may express their biological masculinity or femininity in varied and diverse ways, according to their unique physical and emotional makeup. They are each unique individuals of equal worth, purpose and value to our Creator God. Misguided Gendering The Bible clearly states, \"But from the beginning of the creation God 'made them male and female'\" (Mark 10:6). Christian author and Bible teacher Larry Tomczak correctly clarified, \"People can protest all they want, yet the Scriptures and scientific fact prove that men and women are different and men possess larger bones, lungs, bone density, muscle fiber and something called testosterone. This explains why the fastest female sprinter in the world, Allyson Felix, has a lifetime best in the 440-meter that was handily beaten by 300 high school boys in recent statistics.\" Sensuous and confusing times like these were described by the apostle Paul in key verses of Romans 1: Refusing to know God, they soon didn't know how to be human either\u2014women didn't know how to be women, men didn't know how to be men. Sexually confused, they abused and defiled one another, women with women, men with men\u2014all lust, no love. And then they paid for it, oh, how they paid for it\u2014emptied of God and love, godless and loveless wretches (Rom. 1:26-17, MSG). Unfortunately, many are reluctant to confront these radical, gender-ideologies and social changes directly for fear of being called hateful and hurtful names. They don't want to truthfully and objectively say that LGBTQ ideology and high-risk, sexual practices are harmful and destructive beliefs and behavior, based on junk science and sensual lust. In the name of \"equality,\" this executive order claims (without any scientific evidence) that there is no difference physically between biological boys and girls. It marginalizes women, confuses children and feminizes boys. In an op-ed in The Washington Post last year, three current or former female athletes\u2014Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova and Sanya Richards-Ross\u2014asserted: \"The evidence is unequivocal that, starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science.\" There is nothing \"equal\" or \"fair\" in pitting biological boys against biological girls. Chromosomes don't lie nor are they confused. This binary pair of individuals may express their biological masculinity and femininity in varied and diverse ways, according to their unique physical and emotional makeup. These gendered expressions are neither identical nor interchangeable but essential to God's creational plan. These physical differences are to be embraced as divine design. This is why males and females are (uniquely) equipped sexually to physically reproduce (Gen. 1:28, 2:20). They are biologically and emotionally equipped to fulfill a mutually-complementary and covenantal relationship before their Creator God (Eph. 5:21-33). This is why the apostle Paul challenges homosexual partnerships as deviating from the natural relations or natural function of male-female sexual intercourse (Rom. 1:26-27), as designed and ordained by our Creator God. The Bible clearly teaches that men should not act sexually as women (Lev. 18:22, Rom. 1:18-32, 1 Cor. 6:9-10) or dress like women (Deut. 22:5), and when men or women approve of or engage in other-gendered expressions of identity, it is a disgrace (1 Cor. 11:14-15). We do not have an inalienable right to do whatever we want with our physical selves. We are all made in the image of God and are to glorify Him in our bodies and in our spirits, which belong to Him, as our Creator (1 Cor. 6:12-20). The apostle Paul taught that God's wrath is revealed against those \"who suppress the truth through unrighteousness\" (Rom. 1:18). Tampering with God's created order will not go well\u2014whether for common sinners nor politicized legislators and presidents.

So when the White House pushed back against what it describes as attacks against two of their recently appointed staffers, it acted as if it was striking a blow for decency against bias, meanness and partisanship. The fact that the two who were under fire came from two very different backgrounds\u2014one a Jewish American and the other a Palestinian American\u2014made the support they received from President Joe Biden all the more important. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne sounded a note that seemingly all Americans could get behind when she said the following: \u201cWe are appalled by recent spurious accusations against our staff. We welcome oversight and scrutiny, but there is no justification for false and ad hominem attacks based on ethnic, racial or religious identity.\u201d The seemingly perfect symmetry of both a Jew and a Palestinian being abused in the same way sets up the administration for the kind of virtue signaling that they assumed would generate universal applause. But not so fast. In lumping attacks directed at Deputy National Security Adviser for Cybersecurity Anne Neuberger in with criticism of Maher Bitar, the National Security Agency\u2019s senior director for intelligence, the White House was performing a not-so-subtle sleight of hand trick. The goal was to allow outrage at the clearly illegitimate attacks on Neuberger for having dual loyalty because of her family foundation\u2019s support for AIPAC to serve as cover and to distract from the entirely justified questions raised about Bitar\u2019s past as a BDS activist. Neuberger is an Orthodox woman from Brooklyn, N.Y., and the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. Her parents were among those passengers rescued by Israeli commandos in the 1976 Entebbe raid. Having grown up in what has been described as one of America\u2019s 100 wealthiest families, she has a background in finance but has spent the last 12 years at the NSA in non-political jobs working under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and now Biden, who has tapped her to head the unit working to counter cyber threats. No Orthodox woman has risen higher in national security affairs. As the first Palestinian American to hold such a powerful position, Bitar is also a groundbreaker. He was the first Palestinian American ever to serve in the White House when Obama chose him to be director of Israel and Palestinian Affairs at the National Security Council. He has also served in a variety of posts, including as a deputy to America\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. During the last administration, he served as general counsel for the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, where he worked closely with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to promote accusations that Trump was guilty of collusion with Russia, which were ultimately proved false, and then on the effort to impeach him. As a reward for his service to his party, he is now in a position of unique power as the man who decides what intelligence is fed to the White House, as well as priorities for security operations. So while both Neuberger and Bitar can be considered role models for demographic groups that were not to be seen in the corridors of power in the past, there\u2019s a world of difference between the criticisms they were subjected to in the last week. Neuberger was the target of a spurious hit job by the left-wing magazine Mother Jones that was picked up by NBC News (though the latter ultimately retracted it for not meeting their standards of journalism). In it, David Corn, a longtime bitter critic of Israel and its supporters, questions Neuberger\u2019s fitness for a national security position because her family foundation has supported pro-Israel causes and AIPAC, the umbrella pro-Israel lobby. The clear implication of the piece was that no one who is connected to pro-Israel organizations should be trusted with America\u2019s secrets because they are likely to be guilty of dual loyalty, a traditional anti-Semitic trope. In it, Corn dug up the outrageous charges of espionage against two AIPAC employees that were dropped as groundless and, of course, also raised the Jonathan Pollard affair in an attempt to show that Israel is a threat to the United States. Corn, who has always brandished his own Jewish background as a defense against criticism of his anti-Israel bias, defended himself on Twitter by citing a passage from Obama\u2019s recent book venting his own grudges against AIPAC because it opposed some of his dangerous policies. The point of the article was not so much to take a deep dive into the list of the charities that Neuberger\u2019s family supports, which is both impressive and praiseworthy, but to make it clear that loyal Americans who deserve to be trusted with secrets should have nothing to do with pro-Israel causes. By stigmatizing American Jews who support the alliance with the Jewish state, Mother Jones was making it clear that only Jews who divest themselves of a basic element of Jewish identity and faith\u2014love of Israel\u2014deserve office. That\u2019s an anti-Semitic smear that can be categorized with other recent attacks on Jews such as those of Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who have also raised the dual-loyalty charge, claiming that Jews are buying Congress and manipulating U.S. foreign policy. The questions raised about Bitar focus on the fact that while he was a student at Georgetown University, he was a board member of Students for Justice in Palestine\u2014a group that is notorious for spreading anti-Semitic libels against Israel and Jews, as well as for promoting divestment and boycotts of the Jewish state. At Georgetown, he organized a conference of the Palestine Solidarity Movement at which he ran a session on how to demonize Israel and appeared alongside speakers who praised terrorism against Jewish targets. But rather than a youthful folly, other items on his resume show that he took his BDS beliefs with him on his path towards success in government. He interned at the anti-Israel Foundation for Middle East Peace and then worked at the U.N. Relief Works Agency, which has perpetuated the Palestinian refugee problem in order to serve as a weapon to use against Israel. At no point in his glittering career is there a record of him disavowing BDS and its goal of destroying Israel or the anti-Semitic smears it propagates. Are the charges against Bitar the moral equivalent those against Neuberger? That\u2019s only true if you think defending the existence of the one Jewish state on the planet is morally equivalent to an anti-Semitic war to destroy it. There can be no religious test for office or one based on one\u2019s ethnic origin. Palestinian Americans and Jews should be judged on their individual merits, not on their faith or background. But we do have a right to ask why a record of supporting a hate group like SJP is treated as a non-issue by the administration. And we should be outraged that it thinks support for a pro-Israel cause is just as legitimate as backing one that wishes to wipe out the Jewish state. We have no doubt that Neuberger will serve Biden and the nation just as well as she served Obama and Trump in her efforts to defend the country against cyber threats. But we have every reason to wonder why an administration that assures us that it supports the alliance with Israel is putting one of the most important national security jobs in the hands of someone like Matar, who, in the absence of any disavowal of his past connections and positions, may still wish to see that ally disappear.
