The motive for\u00a0the reported attack hasn't been immediately clear, however, the situation in\u00a0Myanmar has been extremely tense since\u00a0the escalation in\u00a0August 2017, when Rohingya insurgents attacked government security posts. The attacks prompted a response by\u00a0Myanmar\u2019s authorities, which resulted in\u00a0clashes and the deaths of\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0Rohingya, and forced thousands of\u00a0others to\u00a0flee to\u00a0Bangladesh. The situation has been harshly criticized by\u00a0the global community, which has called for\u00a0an end to\u00a0violence.

So what exactly has gone wrong in Germany\u2019s army? It emerged last week that the German military can\u2019t find enough money to fund a long-awaited modernization of its newest Puma infantry fighting vehicles \u2013 which to many didn\u2019t exactly come as a surprise. Indeed, the news added to a steady stream of stories describing how poorly the Bundeswehr is performing, both in peacetime and during overseas deployments in conflict zones. Local newspapers are full of accounts about combat aircraft that lack vital parts or suffer technical failures, tanks and armored vehicles that can\u2019t operate, or soldiers that sympathize with the Third Reich and its armed forces, the Wehrmacht. This defies the stereotypes many people have about the Germans, who are known for being ultra-organized and notoriously pedantic. They excel in engineering and technology, and their arms manufacturers ThyssenKrupp, Kraus-Maffei and Rheinmetall are in the top 100 of the world\u2019s defense contractors, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Moreover, the Germans are historically known for producing a fierce army during two world wars, and one which became a key NATO tool to protect Western Europe from the perceived threat of a Soviet offensive during the Cold War. Recent events have thrown the nation\u2019s military prowess into question, however, and beg the question: what exactly is wrong with the German military, and is it actually vanishing as a fighting force? In September 2014, the Bundeswehr sent a mechanized battalion to take part in NATO\u2019s wargames in Norway. It was later reported that the German unit, trained as part of NATO's Rapid Response Force, was short of small arms and night vision goggles, and its Boxer armored vehicles had no weapons at all. But the soldiers \u2013 in the best traditions of Teutonic genius \u2013 knew what to do. They took broomsticks, painted them black and mounted them on their Boxers\u2019 turrets to simulate 12.7mm heavy machine guns. German command tried to downplay the incident, insisting the soldiers didn\u2019t need the weapons at all. However, the broomstick-wielding German battalion quickly made headlines and left a lasting impression on the public \u2013 who didn\u2019t need to wait all that long until more revelations arrived suggesting that one of world\u2019s economic giants was turning into a military dwarf. In November of last year it became known that more than half of the Bundeswehr\u2019s tank fleet is unfit for service. Only 95 out of 244 Leopard 2 main battle tanks were said to be combat-ready, while the remaining tanks were either disarmed or lacked critical spare parts. Putting boots on the ground in hostile zones was also a tough task for Germany, as soldiers deployed as part of a UN mission to Mali ran into trouble with their armored vehicles, which have been forced out of action because of heat, dust and irregular terrain. The state of the German Air Force doesn\u2019t appear to be any better. In 2014, Spiegel magazine reported that a confidential defense paper described the Luftwaffe\u00a0der Bundeswehr \u2013 the\u00a0army's air arm \u2013 as being in catastrophic disrepair. Painting a grim picture, it said only seven of the 67 CH-53 transport helicopters were in top condition \u2013 including those used in Afghanistan at the time. Later, in 2016, the air force began to repeatedly ground its Cold War-era Tornado jets due to technical mishaps, including \u201cloose screws\u201d that threatened pilots\u2019 safety and poor cockpit lighting. Tragically, the poor condition of the aircraft fleet seems to have been a factor in an incident in August last year, when a Tiger attack helicopter crashed while on a combat mission in Mali, killing two pilots on board. The Defense Ministry admitted the helicopter had lost rotor blades and other parts 10 seconds before ramming into the Malian desert. The helicopter\u2019s full fuel tanks and weapons load turned it into a \u201cfireball,\u201d leaving no chance for the crew to survive. The stories of faulty equipment and failures aren\u2019t limited to tanks and grounded jets. German submariners, whose forbearers wreaked havoc on Allied convoys some 80 years ago, have similar problems, too. Last October, the German Navy\u2019s newest Type 212A submarine \u2013 said to be capable of navigating submerged for over two weeks without resurfacing \u2013 hit a rock during a diving maneuver off the Norwegian coast. The unfortunate incident effectively left Germany without its entire submarine fleet, as two other Type 212A vessels are undergoing scheduled maintenance and will be fit for deployment no sooner than the second half of 2018. Another two subs are also in need of repairs after suffering damage. It would be unfair to say that German military chiefs are doing nothing to fix their army. The Defense Ministry reportedly plans to spend some \u20ac100 million (US$124 million) on global consultancy firms, including the Big Four\u2019s Ernst & Young and KPMG, to make the army\u2019s logistics and procurement more efficient. The defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, has repeatedly said she is determined to push for change to make the Bundeswehr a more capable force. In a somewhat bizarre step, the army itself has even launched a reality show \u2013 Die Rekruten, or \u2018The Recruits\u2019 \u2013 in a bid to revive manpower. However, this merely served to uncover a whole new set of problems. German soldiers, with their reputation of being disciplined, reliable and well-trained fighters, have always been the strongest part of the nation\u2019s armed forces down the years. Today, this image has been tarnished by a series of high-profile scandals, ranging from professional soldiers being detained on pedophilia charges to the rising number of reported rapes and cases of sexual abuse in the Bundeswehr. Among other scandals, some deal with the controversial topic of Nazi sympathies among some soldiers. The Bundeswehr was officially created months before West Germany\u2019s entry into NATO in 1955, and was founded by former officers of the Third Reich. Hasso von Mannteufel, who came up with the name \u2018Bundeswehr\u2019, invaded the USSR as a tank battalion commander, while Adolf Heusinger, the first senior officer-in-command of the Bundeswehr, was one of the Wehrmacht\u2019s main strategists who planned the invasions of Poland, Norway and France. A concept of \u2018citizens in uniform\u2019 was introduced, and the defense chiefs officially stated in 1982 that the Wehrmacht \u2013 a name still notorious to many Russians and Europeans \u2013 does not serve as the \u201cfoundation of a tradition\u201d for the Bundeswehr. Yet this doesn\u2019t seem to have fully taken root. Last year, numerous Wehrmacht memorabilia and Nazi-era artefacts were discovered inside several barracks. These included posters glorifying Nazi soldiers, as well as distinctive German steel helmets and replicas of the Wehrmacht\u2019s standard issue weapons. The uncomfortable revelation prompted the military to launch a thorough probe, with Defense Minister von der Leyen saying: \u201cwe need a broad process in the military itself, that we must travel together, from recruits to generals, from instructors to the minister.\u201d The far-right row was preceded by another scandal that revolved around Franco Albrecht, a 28-year-old first lieutenant who was allegedly plotting a hate-motivated terrorist attack. Investigators alleged the officer had been living a double life for more than a year, serving in the army while receiving state benefits under a bogus identity as a supposed Syrian refugee. Posing as an asylum seeker-turned-terrorist, he reportedly planned to shift the blame for an attack onto migrants \u2013 a kind of a false-flag operation. However, investigators ultimately came to the conclusion that there was no acute danger. Later, German media added fuel to the row sweeping the Bundeswehr ranks after members of Germany's elite KSK special forces unit were accused of staging a controversial farewell party for an outgoing officer. The party featured what was described by some media as a sex worker invited as a \u201cprize\u201d for the KSK commander, some songs of by ultra-right rock band Sturmwehr, as well as Nazi gestures which the elite soldiers preferred to a standard, internationally adopted military salute. As outrage mounted, military leaders were forced to act. \u201cIf we want to modernize the 35-year-old set of the Bundeswehr\u2019s traditions, we must also address the issue of names given to [army] bases,\u201d von der Leyen said at the time. \u201cI think that the Bundeswehr must make it absolutely clear that it does not stand for the traditions of [Nazi Germany\u2019s] Wehrmacht,\u201d she said. Among the measures proposed was a push to rename German bases bearing the names of Nazi soldiers, including the 9th Armored Training Brigade\u2019s base, which carries the name of Adelbert Schulz, one of Hitler\u2019s generals, who participated in the 1940 invasion of Belgium and then fought the Soviet Army in Ukraine in 1944. Another facility, the air force\u2019s NCO school, was named after Hans-Joachim Marseille, a Luftwaffe pilot glorified by Nazi propaganda as the \u2018Star of Africa\u2019. Since the end of the Cold War, the Bundeswehr has taken part in numerous conflicts around the world. Afghanistan, Mali and Iraq \u2013 where the Germans train Kurdish militias \u2013 are on the list of current deployments, but the government in Berlin is signaling there could be more. \u201cA quarter century of contraction is over. It is time for the Bundeswehr to grow again,\u201d von der Leyen announced in 2016. The German military is expected to develop qualitatively and quantitatively, with more troops being sent abroad as part of multinational operations. Experts say, however, that the ambitious strategy runs counter to with Germany\u2019s own laws. \u201cAs long as the Bundeswehr isn\u2019t operating strictly according to the UN Charter, the Federal Government violates the use of the Bundeswehr contrary to its own Constitution and the Soldiers\u2019 Act,\u201d Willy Wimmer, a former state secretary to the German defense minister, told RT. The Basic Law says Berlin has no right \u201cto participate in a war of aggression,\u201d Wimmer argued, with the 1999 Yugoslavia War and other operations clearly appearing to violate this provision. \u201cUnder the constitution, Germany has to contribute to [ensuring] peace in the world. This doesn\u2019t come by participating in wars of aggression and / or disregard of the UN Charter,\u201d he said. These broader questions on the Bundeswehr\u2019s role, coupled with the steady stream of news on its deficiencies, leaves Germany\u2019s military officials and politicians with much to think about. It will take all of the renowned German invention and attention to detail to get the armed forces back in fighting shape.  Like this story? Share it with a friend!

The 47-year-old Finnish woman met the Iraqi asylum seeker, who was then 17 years old, near\u00a0Helsinki Railway Station in\u00a0November 2015. The man allegedly got lost and asked for\u00a0directions. The woman and the man exchanged phone numbers and began to\u00a0keep in\u00a0touch. In the beginning, contact was difficult and discussions were made using a largely improvised sign language and rudimentary English. Later, the man learned a lot of\u00a0words and became increasingly proficient in\u00a0Finnish. Over time, the woman and the man became friends and began to\u00a0spend more time together. Although the man never moved into\u00a0the woman's place, as\u00a0the landlord would not accept it, the woman regarded him as\u00a0a close person and eventually developed a deep and lasting bond, describing it as\u00a0a mother-son relationship.  Vantaa District Court, which considered the adult adoption, considered that the case was unfounded. In order for\u00a0an adult to\u00a0be able to\u00a0adopt another adult person, they should have an established long-term relationship that arose when the adoptee was still a child, which clearly isn't the case here. Consequently, the district court considered that the relationship between\u00a0the Finnish women and her Iraqi fosterling did not meet the requirement. After the man appealed the verdict by\u00a0the district court, the Helsinki Court of\u00a0Appeals found no reason for\u00a0a new hearing. The woman chose not to\u00a0appeal.

According to\u00a0Shapiro, the departure of\u00a0a neighbor with\u00a0who a refugee has developed a helping and supporting relationship suddenly \"disappears\" after\u00a0being moved to\u00a0another accommodation. Moving immigrant families to\u00a0smaller communities was also found to\u00a0have an impeding effect on\u00a0their daily lifestyle due to\u00a0a lack of\u00a0contacts and the necessity of\u00a0having to\u00a0build new a new network from\u00a0scratch. Lastly, living in\u00a0a community, where no one has the same background or speaks the same language encumbered contact with\u00a0locals, spurring a feeling of\u00a0isolation.  \"When children and parents don't have a network in\u00a0the new local communities, the family core can be a vulnerable arrangement for\u00a0family life,\" Shapiro argued. Shapiro's findings contradict the current Danish policy of\u00a0dispersing immigrants equally to\u00a0all municipalities in\u00a0the country, in\u00a0accordance with\u00a0the so-called \"Spreading law\" from\u00a01999. According to\u00a0the law, the migrants are to\u00a0spend at\u00a0least three years in\u00a0the assigned municipality\u00a0\u2014 or risk forfeiting all of\u00a0the social benefits provided by\u00a0the state. The idea of\u00a0this praxis is to\u00a0improve integration and prevent the newcomers from\u00a0settling in\u00a0migrant-heavy areas, commonly referred to\u00a0as 'ghettos.'

Advertisers of all stripes are vying for the attention of the 111 million viewers expected to tune in. The goal is to be the most-talked about ad over the water cooler -- or Slack chatroom -- come Monday morning.From Steven Tyler de-aging for Kia to Amazon's imagining of different voices for Alexa, here are 10 ads that are likely to be talked about. And if you're not interested in tuning it to watch the big game on Sunday, you can stream all of these ads ahead of time.------AmazonThe internet giant's founder, Jeff Bezos, stars in this 90-second comedic ad showing different celebrities including chef Gordon Ramsay, actress Rebel Wilson, singer Cardi B and actor Anthony Hopkins subbing in for the voice of Amazon's voice assistant Alexa.------BudweiserAnheuser-Busch dispenses with its usual Clydesdales and puppies and instead goes with a 60-second ad that depicts, to the tune of \"Stand By Me,\" the company's program to provide water to areas in need. ------Bud LightThe beer brand's recent ads have centered on a Game of Thrones-like universe that uses the meaningless-but-catchy phrase \"Dilly Dilly.\" Now, in a 60-second ad running in the second quarter, the brand introduces \"Bud Knight,\" a heroic character who is ambivalent about helping out in a battle.------Coca-ColaThe soda maker strives to include everyone in its 60-second ad: people of different ethnicities, someone in a wheelchair and a person who uses the they/them pronoun are all shot at various locations in Mexico clutching or drinking different varieties of Coke.------Doritos & Mountain DewThe two Pepsico brands have linked spots that show a lip-sync battle between Peter Dinklage, who lip syncs a Busta Rhymes song as a representative for Doritos Blaze, and Morgan Freeman, who lip syncs a song by Missy Elliott for Mountain Dew Ice. ------FebrezeProcter & Gamble's air freshener tackles toilet humor with a 30-second ad airing in the second quarter. It purports to be a documentary about Dave, whose \"bleep don't stink.\" The kicker: Since your Super Bowl party guests are a bunch of not-Daves, you might want to take other precautions against bathroom odor.------KiaThe automaker has enlisted Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler (who last popped up in a Skittles Super Bowl ad two years ago) to promote its Stringer sports car. In the ad, he drives backward so fast that he gets younger thanks to computer-generated magic. In a nod to advertising tropes, the ad also contains a subliminal message if you watch it backward; Kia helpfully provides this version online.------Michelob UltraThe Anheuser-Busch light beer brand has 30-second ads in the second and fourth quarters starring Chris Pratt . In one he runs and does yoga while singing along to \"I Like Beer,\" a remake of a country song from the 1970s.------PepsiThe soda maker calls back to its past Super Bowl advertising efforts with Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Celtics basketball player Kyrie Irving and Cindy Crawford in a 30-second ad airing right before the Justin Timberlake halftime show.------WeatherTechThe maker of car floor mats shows footage of its new factory being built in a 30-second ad in the first half of the game. On-screen text reads: \"At WeatherTech, we built our new factory right here in America. Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?\" It's the fifth consecutive year WeatherTech has advertised during the Super Bowl that all of its operations are in the United States.", "entities": ["Super Bowl", "Steven Tyler", "Kia Motors", "Monday", "Entrepreneurship", "Amazon (company)", "Amazon Alexa", "Chef", "Gordon Ramsay", "Actor", "Rebel Wilson", "Jeff Bezos", "Personal assistant", "Anthony Hopkins", "Short film", "Game of Thrones", "Batman: Under the Hood", "2011 NFL season", "Videotape", "Mexico", "Promoter (entertainment)", "Missy Elliott", "Busta Rhymes", "Duopoly (broadcasting)", "PepsiCo", "Half-time", "Dave Schultz (wrestler)", "Aerosmith", "Singing", "Super Bowl XLVI", "Kia Soul", "Don't ask, don't tell", "Anheuser-Busch", "Shot (filmmaking)", "Catch-22 (film)", "Yoga", "Britney Spears", "Michael Jackson", "List of Super Bowl commercials", "Justin Timberlake", "Boston Celtics", "Kyrie Irving", "Basketball"], "partisanship": "CenterRight", "year": "2018", "model_hero": "ation of Doritos Blaze, and Morgan Freeman, singing a song by", "model_villain": "la his \"Game of Thrones\" character Tyrion Lannister", "model_victim": "70-year-old man in a Doritos ad, and Morgan Fre", "prompt_length_exceeded": true, "duration": {"hero": 3.269730567932129, "villain": 3.250126600265503, "victim": 3.2969448566436768}, "hero": "None", "victim": "None", "villain": "None"}, {"article_id": "1181095461", "publication_date": "2019-02-01 08:56:47", "headline": "Dems Know Nothing About the Appeal of Howard Schultz", "url": "https://patriotpost.us/articles/60910-dems-know-nothing-about-the-appeal-of-howard-schultz", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "False", "themes": "", "media_id": "25626", "media_name": "patriot post", "media_url": "http://patriotpost.us", "origin_country": "Foreign", "article_text": "The former Starbucks CEO is a loyal Democrat, but he\u2019s a straight, white, wealthy male. In decades past, the well-worn path to the White House involved holding a number of political positions. Of the previous 12 postwar presidents, only Dwight Eisenhower was a non-politician \u2014 and he was the general who led the Allied effort in World War II. But since Donald Trump upset that apple cart in his unlikely run to the Republican nomination and the White House, it seems that everyone else who\u2019s succeeded in running a large corporation wants to follow his lead. This phenomenon really began with H. Ross Perot in 1992, and while Perot\u2019s independent campaign that year only drew about 19% of the vote \u2014 and likely split the GOP enough to allow Bill Clinton to win with a 43% plurality \u2014 Perot\u2019s two campaigns inspired other business leaders to try their own runs. (Perot\u2019s second attempt in 1996 gave birth to the Reform Party, which four years later was the vehicle for Trump\u2019s first, short-lived attempt at the White House.) In 2012, businessman Herman Cain led the GOP field for a short time before rumors of an extramarital affair drove him from the race, and four years later Trump was joined in the fray for a time by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Yet no business leader has tried to enter the presidential race from the left side of political center. Sure, Michael Bloomberg has hinted at it, as has billionaire Tom Steyer from the far left, but their whispering campaigns didn\u2019t produce a fraction of the angst that\u2019s greeted Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz recently. As The Wall Street Journal editorial board opined, \u201cDemocrats have since been shrieking like teenagers at a horror movie\u201d at the prospect of a Schultz run. So why are they afraid of a businessman with low name ID jumping into a presidential race sure to have larger-than-life personalities on both major-party tickets? Because he might cost them some precious votes. The former Starbucks CEO has long been a loyal Democrat, but he has a problem that\u2019s summed up well by National Review\u2019s Kevin Williamson: \u201cSchultz \u2026 is on cultural issues where the Democrats are, but he is not culturally where they are, which at the moment is somewhere in the leafy suburbs of Pyongyang.\u201d Schultz is also a straight, white, wealthy male at a time when the \u201cprogressives\u201d are looking for a candidate to check as many \u201cvictim\u201d boxes as possible. (Thus far, though, we haven\u2019t seen the Democrats\u2019 ultimate candidate, which would be a transgender person of color.) So the very idea of Schultz taking his shot is \u201creckless idiocy\u201d that merits a heckler screaming \u201cdon\u2019t help elect Trump!\u201d But PJ Media\u2019s Roger Simon makes the case that there\u2019s room in the center for a candidate who understands the economic idiocy of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and free college but wouldn\u2019t be as hard-line on immigration as Trump, nor would he be at war with the media. While the Fourth Estate wouldn\u2019t be ecstatic about his bid, they may treat Schultz as the adult in the room when compared to Trump. Let\u2019s put it this way: Schultz knows he\u2019d be ground to bits in a Democrat primary race that\u2019s sure to be a contest of who can race farthest left, so why not spend a little money for ballot access to make an independent run and see if America really is a center-left country? If, as they say, the youth of the nation are pining for utopian socialism, the vote split would come from Trump\u2019s side, right? Could it be that leftists know we\u2019re onto their game, leaving Democrats no choice but to try to clear the field? Look for the Leftmedia to dutifully dig up enough dirt on Schultz to dissuade him from running at all.

And, yet, EU\u2019s policy on Iran, assuming such a thing exists, is plagued by contradictions. The EU\u2019s spokesperson for foreign policy, Ms. Federica Mogherini has devoted most of her immense energies operating as a lobbyist for the Islamic Republic. She has visited more than 30 countries to present the Islamic Republic as the poor little lamb facing the American big bad wolf. To show what a special place the mullahs have in her heart, when in Tehran, she wears the full Khomeinist hijab, but when she visits other Islamic capitals she unleashes her peroxide blonde hair in full evidence. In private, EU officials dismiss that as childish symbolism. The problem is that symbolism does matter as much in politics as in poetics. For example, when, just weeks after leaving office, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel heads a delegation of European businessmen to Tehran and praises the Islamic Republic as a rock of stability in the Mideast, some in the Khomeinist leadership will see that as an endorsement of Tehran\u2019s reckless adventurism. For almost two years the EU has fostered the illusion in the Islamic Republic that it can continue doing as it pleases without risking any bad consequence. When the Trump administration unveiled a series of measures to force Tehran to modify aspects of its behavior, the EU rejected the American position but followed all the sanctions that Washington imposed on Iran. At the same time, however, the EU appointed a team to find ways of circumventing those same sanctions. This duality, not to say duplicity, led to the idea of creating an \u201calternative system of trade financial transactions\u201d to help the Islamic Republic sell its oil to Europe and buy European goods and services. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas promises Tehran it would be\u201d accommodated\u201d in the global trading system. The idea that the Islamic Republic merits special favorable treatment was invented by former US President Barack Obama. He created a parallel UN Security Council in the shape of the so-called 5+1 group of powers. The idea was to allow Tehran to ignore six UNSC resolutions that it did not like. Obama also ignored the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by exempting Iran from its terms and conjuring the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (CJPOA) which clearly states it is tailor-made only for Iran. The EU\u2019s special favorable treatment of the Islamic Republic includes keeping mum about over 20 EU citizens currently held as hostages in Tehran. It is also indicated by the mere rap-on-the wrist response of the Europeans to the Islamic Republic\u2019s latest terrorist operations in four European countries. Ironically, a more credible exposure of the destructive role that the Islamic Republic plays in Europe has come from Tehran\u2019s former Ambassador in Berlin Ali Majedi. Majedi is no defector or dissident. He is back in Tehran at the end of his Berlin mission, starting his retirement. However, he told reporters in Tehran that he had seen that the Europeans had \u201cextensive evidence\u201d about Iran\u2019s \u201cdestructive activities\u201d which could not be attributed to \u201cundisciplined elements\u201d in Tehran. Europeans, including British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, delude themselves in believing that by \u201cworking with Iran\u201d they could prevent the Islamic Republic from \u201ccrossing the red lines.\u201d The problem is that the Islamic Republic does not cross those real or imaginary \u201cred lines\u201d. Like the now-defunct Soviet Union in its time, the Islamic Republic\u2019s strategy is to cross only \u201cpink lines\u201d, which constitute 99 percent of the norms of international behavior, whenever possible. The Islamic Republic has no troops in Yemen but manages to keep that tragedy going by helping Houthi rebels hang on to the patch of territory they hold. The last of Iranian military advisers have left Iraq. But they have left behind thousands of Iraqi military who lived in Iran for decades and hold dual nationality to lead pro-Tehran militias. Tehran sets the tune in Beirut not through Iranian troops but by hiring local manpower from all communities, notably the Hezbollah. Of the estimated 80,000 troops that Tehran has in Syria, less than 10 percent are Iranians, others being mercenaries from a dozen countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria itself.  The Islamic Republic has crossed no red-line in Afghanistan but it hires thousands of armed men from all communities, most recently from among the Taliban as well. In the EU countries, Tehran is careful not to cross \u201cred lines\u201d. But, it crosses \u201dpink lines\u201d when it can through mosques, hussainiyahs, religious endowments and fake charities. In Britain alone, the Islamic Republic controls at least a dozen tax-exempt \u201ccharities\u201d, often used for financing violent groups across the globe or simply for money laundering. Part of the EU\u2019s soft spot for the Islamic Republic may be inspired by endemic anti-Americanism which is present in most European political circles, left and right. We saw one example of this latent anti-Americanism last week over the crisis in Venezuela. When members of the Organization of American States (OAS) almost unanimously rejected Nicolas Maduro\u2019s claim to the presidency and endorsed Juan Guaido as Interim President of Venezuela, EU officials and media tried to portray this as another example of the US throwing its weight around. Thus, they began by saying they won\u2019t follow that policy. Once they realized that the anti-Maduro front covered virtually the whole of the Americas and was not another instance of \u201cbullying by Trump\u201d they used duplicity to cover their mistake. They gave Maduro eight days to organize new presidential elections or risk seeing the EU back Guaido\u2019s claim as the OAS, including the US, had done. It was obvious that Maduro won\u2019t accept what would amount to admitting the legitimacy of his presidency. It was obvious that no election could be organized in eight days. It was also obvious that even if an election were held by an illegitimate regime it would have no legitimacy. Anti-American demagoguery had produced a laughable policy. On Venezuela as on the Islamic Republic in Iran, the European Union must remove its anti-US, nowadays presented as only anti-Trump, glasses to see reality.

Her husband, an accomplice, was sentenced to 40 days in jail and ordered to pay $4,018 in fines, according to the Salinas Californian. In addition, they must donate $10,000 to the state\u2019s fund to fight succulent thieves. It is the fourth successful prosecution of plant heists in the Golden State\u2019s wild landscapes, with more investigations underway,\u00a0according to warden Patrick Freeling of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. It\u2019s illegal to remove any plant from state or national parks. Since the arrests volunteers have worked to return thousands of confiscated plants to their wild and windswept Northern California coastal cliffs. But authorities fear that many more crimes have gone undetected. The kidnapped plants \u2014 small and squat blue-green blobs, with rosettes of fleshy leaves tipped in vermilion \u2014 lack the elegance of\u00a0California\u2019s other commonly poached species, such as salmon, bear and elk. It has a moment of beauty when it blooms, erecting a tall stem and a candelabra-like cluster of yellow flowers. Named after William Russell Dudley, the first head of Stanford\u2019s botany department, the plant is adapted to our coast\u2019s cliffs. But all too often, it\u2019s ending up in kitchens and living rooms far overseas. Investigators\u00a0suspect that organized smuggling rings are behind the purloined plants, which\u00a0sell from $40 to $1,000 on Asia\u2019s black market. Millions of people ascending to middle class status and incomes can now afford decorative plant arrangements, is fueling demand. Davis was on a scenic drive with her family to Big Sur when they pulled over onto a Highway 1 turnout at the state park to rescue a toy that her son had dropped in the back seat of the car. They decided to wait a few minutes and eat. \u201cIt was such a coincidental encounter,\u201d Davis recalled. \u201cWe saw the two people coming up off the trailhead. They had several large heavy bags so we waited and watched. They began transferring items from the bags to the car and it only took a minute or two to catch a glimpse of the Dudleyas.\u201d \u201cI got out of the car and approached them, taking a photo of their license plate and the bags,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI asked them if they knew that stealing native plants in a state park is illegal and they both smiled and did not seem concerned.\u201d The bags contained 1,872 flowers of the plant. \u201cI just realize I did something wrong, because I don\u2019t know anything about relevant laws and that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Guanrong Rivera told Judge\u00a0Rafael\u00a0Vazquez\u00a0through a Mandarin interpreter. The global plant smuggling scheme was first revealed by an anonymous phone call to CDFW\u2019s Freeling over the December 2017 holidays. The caller, frustrated at being stuck in a long line while trying to mail a Christmas gift at Mendocino\u2019s tiny post office, was suspicious. A\u00a0man in line ahead of her was shipping 60 packages to China. As the line snaked out the door, she asked what was in the boxes. \u201cThe man put his finger up to his lip and said, \u2018Shhhh, something very valuable,\u2019 \u201d said Freeling. \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d she asked. The man pointed toward the ocean. Alerted by Freeling, U.S. Customs and Border Protection X-rayed the packages\u00a0\u2014 and discovered Dudleya. Other investigations\u00a0followed. In January 2018, Xiao Yang of Roseville was caught at a Caltrans easement in Point Arena with 50 plants. He was fined $5,000, given 3 years probation and ordered to participate in 240 hours of community service. In March, Koreans Hyeongjae Kim and Minguk Cho flew into San Francisco, rented a minivan and drove to Point Arena on the Mendocino Coast, where they were caught stealing 850 plants. They were fined $10,333 each and denied re-entry into the United States without state or federal approval. A trio of foreign poachers \u2014 Liu Fengxia of China and Tae-Hun Kim and Tae-Hyun Kim of Korea \u2013 were caught, also in March, with 2,148 plants in the Humboldt County town of Trinidad. They were fined $10,000 each, forfeited $10,200 in seized cash and also denied re-entry into the United States without authorization. They had fraudulently written \u201cclothing\u201d on the postal service custom forms of boxes holding Dudleya \u2013 a felony. Charges are still pending for multiple suspects who stole plants from Point Reyes National Seashore and coastal Mendocino County. Those alleged smugglers traveled north from Los Angeles, according to Freeling. The suspects operated at night, rappelling over cliffs to get thousands of plants, then returned to Southern California.Related Articles\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tSan Jose: Man arrested in fatal restaurant stabbing\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tLAPD looking into legality of taped city council remarks\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tSan Jose transgender activist, teacher was vengeful \u2018enforcer\u2019 for all-female biker gang, leading to Oakland triple homicide, DA says\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tSt. Louis school gunman had 600 rounds, AR-15-style weapon\t\t\n\n\nEnvironment |  \n\n\t\t\tCondition of Texas teen shot eating hamburger \u2018touch and go\u2019 \u201cI\u00a0hope that everyone learns from this, from poachers to individuals that think that they can\u2019t do anything to help,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAwareness is so important.\u201d We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

She wore black leggings and a pink fleece with a fluffy pink hood, her wispy blond hair tied in a loose ponytail. She did not especially want to be here. A flu last week had left her tired. A night of science homework lay ahead. On nights like this she wishes things were simpler. She wishes she could be just another girl instead of the girl she is, the famous one, the girl whose YouTube video got 9.3 million hits, the girl whom a British newspaper calls the youngest transgender activist in the world. \u201cDo you get tired talking about this sometimes?\u201d said Rebekah\u2019s mother, Jamie Bruesehoff, 36. \u201cYeah,\u201d Rebekah said. \u201cIt can get hard talking about when I wasn\u2019t myself. Other times I just want to be a normal kid. I just want to go to school. I have to do all that\u00a0homework.\u201d This Friday, the state of New Jersey began to do its part to help Rebekah be the person she is and always was. That\u2019s when the state Department of Health began posting a form on its website allowing transgender, non-binary and intersex people to change their birth certificates from the gender they were assigned at birth to the gender they live. The move comes as the result of a law signed in June by Gov. Phil Murphy. It is named the \u201cBabs Siperstein Law\u201d for the transgender advocate who pushed for it, and who in 2009 became the first openly transgender member of the Democratic National Committee. The law previously passed the legislature twice, but\u00a0\u00a0then-Gov. Chris Christie vetoed\u00a0 it both times. This time, Rebekah Bruesehoff joined other transgender people to lobby for the bill. \u201cShe probably was the most impactful\u201d person to testify on the issue, said Aaron Potenza, a spokesman for Garden State Equality, which advocates for the state\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. \u201cShe is so young, and she was able to speak from the heart. She\u2019s really, really smart. And she\u2019s adorable too.\u201d Rebekah, whose life as a girl belies her male genitalia, will change the gender on her birth certificate from \u201cM\u201d to \"F.\u201d Nonbinary people, whose gender is neither exclusively female nor male, and intersex people, whose bodies do not fit traditional gender definitions, will be able to mark \u201cX.\u201d More: LGBT students in NJ feel harassed, survey finds More: Boy Scouts to pay $18,000, apologize to 9-year-old transgender boy thrown out of pack In the past, people hoping to change the gender on their birth certificates were required to obtain a letter from a therapist attesting to the fact that they experience gender dysphoria, historically defined as the distress arising when a person\u2019s gender assigned at birth does not match that individual\u2019s gender identity. They also were required to produce proof of surgery to change their anatomy. But what intelligent society requires people who know who they are to prove it with surgery? \u201cKids aren\u2019t getting surgery. That\u2019s not a thing,\u201d Jamie Bruesehoff said. \u201cShe may never have surgery. That\u2019s entirely up to her, and that\u2019s an adult decision we\u2019re not going to think about now.\u201d Besides, being transgender doesn\u2019t necessarily cause a person distress. What causes distress is a transgender person trying to live a happy life surrounded by people who bully them, discriminate against them or, in the worst possible cases, murder them. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t a very safe place for trans people,\u201d Bruesehoff said. Rebekah Bruesehoff became an internationally famous transgender activist by accident. It was 2017, and Rebekah and her mother traveled from their home in Vernon, Sussex County, to Jersey City to protest the Trump administration\u2019s decision to rescind rules protecting transgender youth in schools. About 200 people attended the protest, Jamie said. She took pictures of Rebekah holding a sign, which read, \u201cI\u2019m the SCARY transgender person the MEDIA warned you about.\u201d Rebekah was looking extra cute, with a big smile and her blond hair dyed purple. Jamie posted the photos to social media thinking a few people, mostly family members and friends, might see them. Millions of people saw the pictures. Activists in the LGBT community reposted them, seeing in Rebekah a symbol that their movement is kind, friendly and beyond rebuke. \u201cI love Rebekah Bruesehoff so much!!\u201d a woman identified as Jenna from Pennsylvania said on Twitter. \u201cShe is so inspiring!\u201d People who oppose rights for transgender people saw the pictures too, and were frightened by them. One conservative person who posts on Twitter under the handle \u201cChurch of Britain\u201d wrote that \u201cJust because my father dresses me in female clothing dies (sic) not mean I consent to permanent irreversible mutilation if (sic) my genitalia.\u201d The post is incorrect in two respects. The decision to dress as a girl is entirely Rebekah\u2019s, she and her parents said; and she has not yet considered any surgery. Mean Tweets were the least of the family\u2019s problems. Some people contacted the Bruesehoffs to issue death threats against the entire family, Jamie said. Someone called the state's child welfare agency to allege that Jamie and her husband Christopher, a pastor at a local Lutheran church in Vernon, were giving Rebekah hormones and forcing their son to be a girl. The accusation was ludicrous,\u00a0\u00a0the family said. Regardless, workers with the Child Protection and Permanency\u00a0agency were required to visit the home. \u201cIt was really scary,\u201d Jamie Bruesehoff said. \u201cNobody wants someone knocking at your door trying to decide if you\u2019re abusing your kid or not.\u201d This is the kind of treatment that makes psychologists and social scientists worry. More than 41 percent of transgender adults have attempted suicide, a rate nine times higher than the national average, according to the American Institute for Suicide Prevention. But trans children who receive support from their families and friends can buck the trend. For example, transgender children who can live openly as transgendered by using their chosen names experience 71 percent fewer symptoms of severe depression, and report 65 percent fewer thoughts of suicide, according to research published last year by Stephen Russell, chair of the human development and family sciences department at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cBefore I transitioned I couldn\u2019t be myself. It didn\u2019t feel right. I felt lost,\u201d said Rebekah, who publicly transitioned from being a boy to a girl at age 8. \u201cWhen I transitioned I learned that others didn\u2019t have all the supportive family members and school that I had.\u201d The life of a famous pre-teen activist isn\u2019t always so difficult. Last summer Rebekah gave a speech to 31,000 people inside NRG Stadium in Houston for a youth gathering by the Evangelical Lutheran Church. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew they would be very supportive no matter if I messed up.\u201d Likewise, the momentous event of changing Rebekah\u2019s birth certificate will be no big deal. On Friday morning, Jamie planned to search the state health department\u2019s website for the required form. She will pay $6. She will print it, fill it out, and place it in an envelope.

It\u2019s also home to one of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing communities of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who make up one percent of the local population just four years after the first families moved from London. A whopping 72 percent of Canvey Island\u2019s constituency of Castle Point voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum \u2014 21 points above the national result and the third most pro-Brexit of the United Kingdom\u2019s 650 constituencies. Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s anguished pullout from the European Union, is becoming reality this week. It has toppled two cabinets before its achievement became the core policy of the Conservative Party\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson. Brexit\u2019s proponents say it will restore British sovereignty from the EU, which they perceive as increasingly encroaching on domestic issues. Opponents say it is both rooted in and amplifying xenophobia, as well as financially hazardous. Wherever the truth lies, a pro-Brexit bastion like Canvey Island hardly seems like the most intuitive place for ultra-Orthodox Jews to settle down. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Joel Friedman, a 33-year-old father of seven from London, and a handful of his friends did in 2016, when they planted the seed for what has rapidly grown into a community of 76 families who could not afford the housing prices in nearby London. When Friedman presented his plan to members of his community in the heavily ultra-Orthodox London neighborhood of Stamford Hill, the reactions he encountered ranged from dismissiveness to shock, he told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \u201cSome people told us, \u2018Don\u2019t go there, they\u2019re all racists there, they\u2019re all for Brexit,\u2019\u201d he recalled. (Friedman added he believed that ultra-Orthodox Jews who care about Brexit are as split on the issue as other involved members of the general population.) Despite some minor incidents involving anti-Semitism, walking around Canvey Island \u2013 it\u2019s not an island at all \u2014 while wearing the clothes of ultra-Orthodox Jews is \u201cabsolutely safe,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cWe have excellent neighborly relations.\u201d Tony Eaton, who lives next door to several Jewish families, generally concurred \u2014 phrasing it with British understatement. \u201cThey\u2019re not worse than anyone else you might want as your neighbor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep to themselves, mind their own business, and so do we, really,\u201d added Eaton, who voted for the Conservatives and supported getting Brexit done. Anti-Semitic incidents were due to young quarrelsome men, often drunk, rather than any organized ideological group or opposition to Jewish presence, several members of the local Jewish community said in interviews with JTA. Eaton is one of many white, English baby boomers who moved sometime after the 1970s from London to Essex, the county to which Canvey Island belongs. Just like the ultra-Orthodox, the baby boomers came to improve their quality of life and for affordable housing. But many of them also were eager to leave behind the increasingly multicultural metropolis of London, which began seeing an influx of immigrants from Asia, Africa and other parts of Europe about 50 years ago. The so-called white flight to Canvey Island may explain why the center-right Conservative Party has won here in all but one election since 1983. As in the United States, ultra-Orthodox Jews in the United Kingdom seem to vote overwhelmingly for right-wing parties, and Canvey Island\u2019s political orientation has helped its new arrivals feel at home. \u201cWe\u2019re conservative, they\u2019re conservative,\u201d Jacob Gross, a father of six who is in charge of security for Canvey Island\u2019s Jewish community, said of the town\u2019s Jewish and non-Jewish contingents. \u201cDespite our differences, there\u2019s a worldview that we share.\u201d Politics, though, were not what brought the Jews to Canvey Island, which has about 40,000 residents and 16,000 houses. Back in northern London, which is about an hour\u2019s drive from Canvey Island, Friedman was living in a rented home with three bedrooms worth well over a million pounds, or $1.3 million \u2013 a sum that is wholly unaffordable to most ultra-Orthodox families and double what such a property costs in Canvey Island. \u201cEven those who do have the money can\u2019t buy a house there because there\u2019s such a shortage,\u201d said Gross, who supports Brexit even though it caused his outdoor toy business to tank. Uncertainty around Brexit caused the British pound to weaken against the dollar, hurting his profits, he said. \u201cBut Brexit is still the right thing to do for this country,\u201d he said. Friedman and Gross were members of a group of activists who decided to band together and establish a new community in a more affordable market that is still near London. This overflow from Stamford Hill reflects a major demographic development in British Jewry. The ultra-Orthodox are projected to become that minority\u2019s largest group by 2031, according to a 2015 report by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. That year, ultra-Orthodox births accounted for 47 percent of all Jewish births. The non-ultra-Orthodox Jewish birthrate in the United Kingdom is 1.98 children per woman, only slightly above the national average, according to the report. Ultra-Orthodox Jews typically have at least four children and a much smaller rate of assimilation. The beating heart of the Jewish community of Canvey Island is the yeshiva, the local name for a Jewish community center built inside a former school. The yeshiva is located about a mile north of the city center, with its suburban strip mall and shoulderless, patchy roads whose sidewalks are often cluttered with merchandise belonging to the area\u2019s many small construction firms and body shops. The community center has a kosher convenience store, a synagogue and an event hall that is by far the prettiest space in the otherwise decaying building. There are also classrooms for the community\u2019s approximately 350 children. On Shabbat afternoon, many ultra-Orthodox children play on the quiet streets bordering the yeshiva. Officially, the children are all home-schooled. Canvey Island does not have a Jewish school, an amenity whose establishment would require considerable red tape and government oversight. Several ultra-Orthodox schools are facing closure for their alleged failure to teach sex education, evolution and other core requirements. In practice, the yeshiva compound functions as a gender-segregated school, although the classes are called clubs. The place also has a mikvah, a ritual bath. Canvey Island, however, does not have a rabbi. The community is still looking for a suitable candidate, Gross said. Last month, a fire damaged part of the yeshiva center: One of the students forgot to extinguish the Hanukkah menorah. The blaze was extinguished quickly and caused minor damage to the center, Friedman said. The Jewish Community of Canvey Island, a registered charity that represents the Jewish population, arranged for swimming lessons at a nearby pool. Different time slots were set aside for boys and girls, Friedman noted. \u201cLife is great for the children here,\u201d said an ultra-Orthodox resident who moved to Canvey Island and identified himself only as Shaul. \u201cThey can play outside, leave their bikes unlocked. It\u2019s a totally different world to London.\u201d Shaul, his wife and five children moved from Stamford Hill three years ago. They were living in a two-room apartment, he said. \u201cI just love the sea breeze,\u201d he said on a sunny afternoon last month. To be sure, Canvey Island is one of several locales in the United Kingdom where ultra-Orthodox communities from London have settled in recent years in search of affordable housing. There\u2019s Manchester, situated 180 miles north of London, and Gateshead, an ultra-Orthodox town of 8,000 residents located a further 100 miles northward. But in the London area, Canvey Island is one of a kind. \u201cPeople can still work there and live here,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThey can still remain part of family life in Stamford Hill.\u201d His community operates four daily shuttle buses to northern London. With more Jews expressing an interest in moving to Canvey Island, the local Jewish community has taken precautions to avoid this trend of driving up market prices, Gross said. \u201cThere\u2019s a committee. There\u2019s a strict limit on how much we allow newcomers to bid,\u201d Gross said. Supply is rooted in local baby boomers reaching retirement age and selling assets in Canvey Island to buy smaller apartments now that their children have moved out, Friedman explained. \u201cIt means there is availability,\u201d he said, \u201cand room to grow.\u201d Do you rely on The Times of Israel for accurate and insightful news on Israel and the Jewish world?

I am raising $5000 for Dan. Here is how you can help. Big Pharma is not our friend. Dan had the moral courage to expose them. https://www.gofundme.com/manage/lets-help-dan-abshear-big-pharma-whistleblower \u201cThere is a pathologically intimate relationship between corporations and the U.S. government- their collusion is expressed in the revolving door. \u201c In the Spring of 2006, I became a pharmaceutical corporate whistle blower. In February of that year, I had recruited a law firm with experience in pharmaceutical whistle blower lawsuits in Boston, which is a top place to file and submit pharmaceutical whistle blower cases.\u00a0 They agreed to represent me after I submitted a ten page document to them I composed- explaining why the wrongdoing of my employer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, needed to be addressed.\u00a0 They represented me on complete contingency, which meant that they would not be paid if they did not succeed in the whistle blower lawsuit they were submitting for me. The law firm submitted the whistle blower lawsuit against Novartis in April of 2006.\u00a0 And it was filed under seal, which means that I and my legal council cannot discuss the case whatsoever.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trick played by the D.O.J., to eliminate the possibility of media contact. I made a trip to Boston in July of 2006 to be asked hundreds of questions by various relevant government entities, such as the department of health and human services.\u00a0 Also, in the center of a large table in a conference room, was a phone, with numerous attorney generals from various states- all there to hear my answers to the hundreds of questions I was asked one day, for 8 hours.\u00a0 I spoke with complete knowledge of the evidence, and with total honesty.  Continues \u2026 So white gentiles, how\u2019s that having a united cabal of Jews monopolizing all the banks/corporations (Communism) working out for you? WOMEN ARE ALWAYS WITH THE SUCCESSFUL !\nTHEREFORE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE SEDUCTION\nOF MEN !\none has to know from birth on that in this world\nyou cannot rely on anybody ! As a former whistleblower this article supports my years of contention that to ascend in any human institution, even in government and politics, you have to leave your conscience at the door. One can never regret serving the truth and what is right.  Henry\u2019s article also supports the view of just how morally corrupt all of our institutions really are, how the ends always justify the means to those in power, and that those at the so-called \u201ctop\u201d reflect by their deeds the very worst in our human natures.  Just this one example shows the corruption in major drug corporations, our government agencies, our flake politicians sitting in our useless legislatures, the medical community, the legal profession, and in our courts. There is not one spot on the carcass of our body politic which is not covered with putrid puss and sores, a body which has never suffered a cleansing bath much less any real purgation, and all coming from a completely filthy mind in control. Since they\u2019re likely to deplatform this GoFundMe account, I wouldn\u2019t use it\u2026.sorry Mr. Makow.

I\u2019m not surprised that whistleblowers find themselves on a secret blacklist. Decades ago I became unemployable in my local area. I don\u2019t remember exactly what my \u201ccrime\u201d had been. I certainly wasn\u2019t a whistleblower. I wasn\u2019t even a member of a trade union. All I can assume after so long is that it had something to do with my strong sense of injustice, whether committed against myself or another. I had a number of promising job interviews, but every one ended with a statement to the effect that there were other applicants, so \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know\u201d, but they never did. Around that time the local paper ran a story about claims made by others that the employment offices operated a blacklist. They denied this, of course, but they did admit that they would sometimes \u201cnot recommend\u201d certain people for employment and to have a secret number for potential employers to ring to learn about job applicants. If that\u2019s not blacklisting, I don\u2019t know what is. In the end I had to move away and find casual work using a false name until I discovered that this particular blacklist didn\u2019t extend to my new home town, by which time I\u2019d successfully built a reputation as the reliable worker I always had been. If there are blacklists operating at the local level involving low-level employment, it seems obvious to me that there would be something much more sinister and all-pervading at the \u201chigher end\u201d of the jobs market.

Whitehead, Rutherford Institute:  \u201cChildren are being targeted and sold for sex in America every day.\u201d\u2014John Ryan, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children There can only be one winner emerging from this year\u2019s Super Bowl LIV showdown between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs, but the biggest losers will be the hundreds of young girls and boys\u2014some as young as 9 years old\u2014who will be bought and sold for sex during the course of the big game. It\u2019s common to refer to this evil practice, which has become the\u00a0fastest growing business\u00a0in organized crime and the\u00a0second most-lucrative commodity traded\u00a0illegally after drugs and guns as child sex trafficking, but what we\u2019re really talking about is rape.  Adults purchase children for sex at least 2.5 million times a year\u00a0in the United States. It\u2019s not just young girls who are vulnerable to these predators, either. According to a\u00a0USA Today\u00a0investigative report, \u201cboys make up about 36% of children caught up in the U.S. sex industry\u00a0(about 60% are female and less than 5% are transgender males and females).\u201d Consider this:\u00a0every two minutes, a child is exploited in the sex industry. In Georgia alone, it is estimated that\u00a07,200 men (half of them in their 30s) seek to purchase sex with adolescent girls each month, averaging roughly 300 a day. On average, a child might be\u00a0raped by 6,000 men during a five-year period. It is estimated that\u00a0at least 100,000 children\u2014girls and boys\u2014are bought and sold for sex in the U.S. every year, with as many as 300,000 children in danger of being trafficked each year. Some of these children are forcefully abducted, others are runaways, and still others are sold into the system by relatives and acquaintances. Child rape has become Big Business in America. This is an industry that revolves around cheap sex on the fly, with young girls and women who are\u00a0sold to 50 men each day for $25 apiece, while their\u00a0handlers make $150,000 to $200,000 per child\u00a0each year. This is not a problem found only in big cities. It\u2019s happening everywhere, right under our noses, in suburbs, cities and towns across the nation. As Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children points out, \u201cThe only way not to find this in any American city is simply not to look for it.\u201d Don\u2019t fool yourselves into believing that this is merely a concern for lower income communities or immigrants. It\u2019s not. It is estimated that there are\u00a0100,000 to 150,000 under-aged child sex workers in the U.S.\u00a0These girls aren\u2019t volunteering to be sex slaves. They\u2019re being lured\u2014forced\u2014trafficked into it. In most cases, they have no choice. Every transaction is rape. In order to avoid detection (in some cases\u00a0aided and abetted by the police) and cater to male buyers\u2019 demand for sex with different women, pimps and the gangs and crime syndicates they work for have turned sex trafficking into a highly mobile enterprise, with trafficked girls, boys and women constantly being moved from city to city, state to state, and country to country. For instance, the Baltimore-Washington area, referred to as\u00a0The Circuit, with its I-95 corridor dotted with rest stops, bus stations and truck stops, is a hub for the sex trade. No doubt about it: this is a highly profitable, highly organized and highly sophisticated sex trafficking business that operates in towns large and small,\u00a0raking in upwards of $9.5 billion a year in the U.S. alone\u00a0by abducting and selling young girls for sex. Every year, the girls being bought and sold gets younger and younger. The average age of those being trafficked is 13. Yet as the head of a group that combats trafficking pointed out, \u201cLet\u2019s think about what average means. That means there are children younger than 13.\u00a0That means 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds.\u201d \u201cFor every 10 women rescued, there are 50 to 100 more women who are brought in by the traffickers. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not 18- or 20-year-olds anymore,\u201d noted a 25-year-old victim of trafficking. \u201cThey\u2019re minors as young as 13 who are being trafficked.\u00a0They\u2019re little girls.\u201d This is America\u2019s dirty little secret. But what or who is driving this evil appetite for young flesh? Who buys a child for sex? Otherwise ordinary men\u00a0from all walks of life. \u201cThey could be your co-worker, doctor, pastor or spouse,\u201d writes journalist Tim Swarens, who spent more than a year investigating the sex trade in America. Catholic and Protestant churches have been particularly singled out in recent years for harboring these sexual predators. Twenty years after the clergy sex abuse scandal rocked the Catholic Church, hundreds of sexual predators\u2014priests, deacons, monks and lay people\u2014continue to be given work assignments in proximity to children. In many cases, the\u00a0abuse continues unabated. Although much less publicized, the sex crimes within the Protestant Church have been no less egregious. For instance, a recent expose into the Southern Baptist Church leaders by the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u00a0documents over 700 child sex victims \u201cwho were\u00a0molested, sent explicit photos or texts, exposed to pornography, photographed nude, or repeatedly raped by youth pastors. Some victims as young as 3 were molested or raped inside pastors\u2019 studies and Sunday school classrooms.\u201d And then you have national sporting events such as the Super Bowl, where sex traffickers have been caught selling minors,\u00a0some as young as 9 years old. Yet even if the Super Bowl is not exactly a \u201cwindfall\u201d for sex traffickers as some claim, it remains a lucrative source of income for the child sex trafficking industry and a draw for those who are willing to pay to rape young children. According to criminal investigator Marc Chadderdon, these \u201cbuyers\u201d\u2014the so-called \u201cordinary\u201d men who drive the demand for sex with children\u2014represent a cross-section of American society:\u00a0every age, every race, every socio-economic background, cops, teachers, corrections workers, pastors, etc. And then there are the\u00a0extra-ordinary\u00a0men, such as Jeffrey Epstein, the hedge fund billionaire / convicted serial pedophile\u00a0who was arrested on charges of molesting, raping and sex trafficking dozens of young girls, only to die under highly unusual circumstances. It is believed that Epstein operated his own personal sex trafficking ring not only for his personal pleasure but also\u00a0for the pleasure of his friends and business associates. According to\u00a0The Washington Post, \u201cseveral of the young women\u2026say they were\u00a0offered to the rich and famous as sex partners\u00a0at Epstein\u2019s parties.\u201d At various times, Epstein ferried his friends about on his private plane,\u00a0nicknamed the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d Men like Epstein and his cronies, who belong to a\u00a0powerful, wealthy, elite segment of society\u00a0that operates according to their own rules, skate free of accountability by taking advantage of a\u00a0criminal justice system that panders to the powerful, the wealthy and the elite. Still, where did this appetite for young girls come from? Look around you. Young girls have been sexualized for years now in music videos, on billboards, in television ads, and in clothing stores. Marketers have created a demand for young flesh and a ready supply of over-sexualized children. \u201cIn a market that sells high heels for babies and thongs for tweens, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that\u00a0sex, if not porn, has invaded our lives,\u201d\u00a0writes Jessica Bennett for\u00a0Newsweek.\u00a0\u201cWhether we welcome it or not, television brings it into our living rooms and the Web brings it into our bedrooms. According to a 2007 study from the University of Alberta, as many as 90 percent of boys and 70 percent of girls aged 13 to 14 have accessed sexually explicit content at least once.\u201d Read More @ Rutherford.org", "entities": ["Super Bowl XLIV", "San Francisco", "Illegal drug trade", "Sex trafficking in the United States", "USA Today", "United States", "Georgia (U.S. state)", "Orders of magnitude (mass)", "Pareidolia", "Orders of magnitude (numbers)", "Rape", "50 (number)", "Human trafficking in the United States", "Ernie Allen", "National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "100,000", "Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area", "Child", "Thirteenth grade", "Minor (law)", "Journalist", "The Real McCoys", "Southern Baptist Convention", "Houston Chronicle", "Detective", "Mick Stallard", "Jacob Epstein", "Lolita (disambiguation)", "Millennium", "Ageism"], "partisanship": "FarRight", "year": "2020", "model_hero": "", "model_villain": "", "model_victim": "is not only happening in the so-called underground world of illegal prostitution", "prompt_length_exceeded": true, "duration": {"hero": 0.6299922466278076, "villain": 0.6322915554046631, "victim": 3.221602439880371}}, {"article_id": "1513859517", "publication_date": "2020-02-06 01:27:10", "headline": "Birmingham dad who opposed LGBT lessons faces jail", "url": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=202049", "language": "en", "ap_syndicated": "False", "themes": "", "media_id": "31382", "media_name": "thetruthseeker.co.uk", "media_url": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk#spider", "origin_country": "Foreign", "article_text": "by tts-admin | Feb 6, 2020 | 15 comments Concerned parents and their children held protests outside Parkfield Community School (Birmingham) for months. Click to enlarge A Birmingham dad who refused to submit to a school\u2019s controversial and insensitive sexual equality policy is facing jail over his non-compliance. Jabar Hussain, 51, refused to let his son attend school because of a protracted dispute at Parkfield Community School in Alum Rock (Birmingham) over compulsory lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) lessons. Hussain, like many other Muslim parents, refused to allow his child to attend the lessons on religious grounds. The school suspended the so-called equality lessons in March 2019 (officially called the No Outsiders programme) only to re-introduce them in June, a move which infuriated concerned parents. Concerned parents, most of whom are Muslim, have long argued that the programme is a cover for promoting homosexuality and transgenderism. The concerned parents have argued that young children should not be exposed to such contentious issues at a tender age. Mr Hussein faces a hefty fine (to the tune of \u00a32,500) and a potential three-month jail sentence for refusing to let his nine-year-old son attend school, where he would have been exposed to the controversial No Outsiders programme. Mr Hussain is reportedly seeking a judicial review on the grounds that the controversial programme is \u201cincompatible\u201d with his rights and Muslim faith. The judicial review has been proposed on \u201csafeguarding risk\u201d grounds in so far as it allegedly promotes distorted notions of gender identity. The legal case, in addition to broader issues related to the controversial No Outsiders programme, is widely seen as an example of deep communal divisions and religious tensions in Britain. In addition, the school\u2019s and Birmingham City Council\u2019s insistence on implementing the controversial programme against the wishes of concerned parents has given rise to fears that the British establishment is determined to impose its norms and values on ethnic and religious minorities. Protesting parents were further dismayed in March 2019, when the Office for Standards in Education, Children\u2019s Services and Skills (Ofsted \u2013 the government department responsible for inspecting schools) ruled that the No Outsiders programme is \u201cage-appropriate\u201d. Source A brave man, fighting for his beliefs. Where\u2019s the rest of British parents? Where is your Christian zeal in this issue? I suspect totally gone as this rubbish wouldn\u2019t be in our classrooms in the first place. We are doomed, pedo lessons coming soon, i bet!! Jabar Hussain is protesting against this brainwashing campaign. What about English Aboriginals, do they accept this barbarity? Do they believe in \u201csexual orientations\u201d? Soon after the LGBT bull dust even the pedophilia will be legalized . What happens to the\nfreedom to have a dissenting opinion ? and the freedom of free speech ? Should the freedom of the individual be  subservient to the LGBT mambo Jambo ?  Now only the LGBT bull  s\u2026.. is the only opinion permissible and this beg this question about the Judges with who are  aligned the members of \u201d Judicial reviews \u201d ? Should this group be dismantled because no longer serves the needs of the wider community ? Why did the people ever allow or agree to the State taking charge of their children\u2019s education?    Why do people agree to it now?    Why are the Christians and others allowing this incredible abuse of their own children? If this muslim gent and his family can, they should return to their country of origin or a coyntey that does nor mandate this madness as education\u201d. It is better to suffer poverty than to be brought to ones knees obeying the commands of this Satanic ruling cult that insist on corrupting their precious children. As Malcom X said \u201cOnly a fool would let his enemy educate his children\u201d It is not christians or muslims This is all satanic and why we allow \u2026 It is a file and repulsive programme which should be stamped out at its roots,any respectable parent would and should take the same attitude as this man and if necessary mass demonstrations to support their actions against this practice. million Getaneh:  You are correct. People in the West have been given a constant dose of secularism. The same way that you can poison someone, by administrating a slow dose of poison without the persons knowledge, will ultimately lead to dead. That \u201cpoison\u201d of secularism was administrated in the educational system, entertainment, media and publishing and ultimately into the political realm. Even organized Religion has fallen victim to this diabolical scheme, by providing only \u201clip service\u201d, but there hearts are far from it. If a Nation turns its against the Creator, He will turn against that Nation. Divide and conquer lol where is the people power? Thing is it is still here but we are blinded the pit us against each other then they bend us over and lbgt us very hard. Get together over me dumb dumb dumb dumb. Let\u2019s first get our people as one white, black, Asian, Indian, arab, and all other cultures and creeds that\u2019s the only way we can win. Let\u2019s be as one and stop this his black his white his muslim his so and so and work as one unit. If we don\u2019t we have no hope what so ever. The photo above indicates that the only really decent people left in our nations who tend to have children and protect family values are non-whites and mostly Muslim. As a white person in Canada I can see even our separate schools overrun with the LGBT nonsense without a peep from the white parents with 1.2 children per family, and who really do not give a shit about anything but material prosperity and social status. When I look around for stable and straight families I only see a smattering of white Christian ones, in a sea of Sikh, Muslim, and Chinese ethnic communities which are thriving with family normalcy, children and prosperity \u2013 unless they are second and third generation types who have been brainwashed by the secular social engineering through our corrupt media and educational systems. Party politics is the tool to devide specially if the parties are all United under one banner. Henry h ..Where\u2019s the rest of British parents?\nThe answer is, they are part of the LGBTQRXYZ association \u2026. Believe it or not, our masters tested the water with the smoking ban. It was about control and public reaction. They were testing how the public would behave when you took away a basic right of them, by banning smoking in public places and of course, backed up your views with health scares. They found that overall, the public weren\u2019t that bothered, especially after being brainwashed with the \u2018passive smoking causes cancer\u2019 BS. And voila, 20+ years later and they\u2019re enforcing sodomy to be taught into schools and no one\u2019s really complaining. After all, they\u2019ve all got used to the sodomite brigade on the TV, from the Liberaches, to the John Inmans, the Larry Graysons to the Kenny Everets, the Freddie Mercurys to the Boy Georges and literally every second individual, on the TV and radio being a raging queen. So, obviously they accept the globohomo reality that now is. Just like Juden, the homosexuals, a tiny minority now have the upper hand, essentially now first class citizens, above everyone else who now are second class, the heterosexuals I believe they\u2019re called. Next step, arresting fathers who beat up paedophiles, who\u2019ve been trying to nonse their children. The psychologists are already promoting the \u201cthey were born that way\u201d just as they did with the homosexuals. I stated when I started blogging the simple truth \u2013 \u201cwhen you allow one taboo into society, you have no moral high ground into condemning the others\u201d. Pandora\u2019s box was opened and now we have the hell that\u2019s coming to face because of it.\nIt takes a Muslim, an immigrant to speak out against wrong in western society. This shows how pathetic it now is.\nHowever, that stated, the Muslims will get the last laugh. The homosexuals may currently be laughing but not in the future. Roll on 2030 and the Muslim population, completely anti indigenous and homosexual will be forcing their way of life on the rest. Roll on 2040 and it will have grown even more. Roll on 2050 and 2060 and they\u2019ll be winning lots of local elections, voting as a tribal block. And in will come an Islamic, Sharia party, instantly disbanding the House of Lords, the monarchy (good riddance I say) and ending all democracy every again (not that there ever was) and implementing the Muslim state, under the will of Allah. The homosexual men will be hanged. The homosexual women will be given a choice \u2013 pump out babies or join their male counterparts. Islamisation of the UK will certainly happen by 2060, very probably before. You won\u2019t see any sodomites laughing then, I can assure you of that.\nThis article shows one thing really and one thing only \u2013 the indigenous of the UK, don\u2019t deserve survival. Any country that allows sodomy, to be promoted in schools and to young children as natural, normal and moral behaviour, doesn\u2019t deserve to exist sadly. They hate and demonize islam because it is against everything they do or believe in. For example isis, al Qaeda, and daesh they are not muslim they kill muslims every day, they bomb mosques these are the enemies who pretend to be muslim but are in fact an army put there to demonize and kill muslims. We believe that every human being is born muslim first. Born innocent islam will be the last stand against these people they fear it. Christianity has been hijacked I mean they have made a film in the film jesus is gay why do the Christian\u2019s allow this? Wheres the love? indigenous, ie, white and / or Christian brits are charged with \u2018hate crime\u2019 laws whenever they object to novel indoctrination methods. The only reason this protest got as far as it did was because of the large concentration of muslims in the area.  In other regions, individual parents complaining have been reported to the local social services department for \u2018abusing\u2019 their children by teaching them to be hateful, and they have had to suffer the threat or reality of losing custody of their children to the state. In Germany home schooling has effectively been criminalised. Our courts do not approve of us anymore when it comes to \u2018hate crimes\u2019; we are all guilty until we can complete the impossible task of disproving a null hypothesis, with the harshest punishments considered just reward.  Hate laws do not care for the intent of the accused, only the \u2018feelings\u2019 of those crying \u201cI am offended by your hatefulness\u201d.   In some opinions, we have a two-tier justice system where the more traditional brits are automatically fascist, racist Nazis who are presumed highly likely to become violent or incite violence in others. This is (was) the globalist plan for the world \u2013 no more straight whites or Christians: everyone else gets a free pass.

He planted an American flag in 1846 into the city\u2019s soil to claim the land for the United States. A website that catalogs \u201cinteresting\u201d locations around the world wrote about the controversy: In the 1980s, San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery had the city commission a statue of Fallon raising the U.S. flag in San Jose at a cost of over $800,000. The statue was completed in 1988, and was scheduled to be located in the City Park Plaza (now known as Plaza de C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez) near the site of the flag raising. However local groups, including Hispanic Americans, protested that Fallon represented American imperialism and repression of the Mexican population. The statue was stored until 2002, when it was finally displayed in a small park northwest of the original proposed location, near Julian and St. James Streets.\u201d A now, even the more low-key location is being challenged, according to the San Francisco Chronicle report on public meetings held on the statue\u2019s fate: Community members used their 1-minute allotted time to persuade city officials to get rid of the controversial 16-foot-tall statue, many using the same words to describe Fallon\u2019s legacy: Colonialism. Imperialism. Racism. Injustice. White supremacy. Violence. Genocide. Fallon was one of the \u201csoldiers of John C. Fremont\u2019s brigade that was involved in the war with Mexico\u201d from 1846 to 1848, and he went on to serve one yearlong term as San Jose\u2019s 10th mayor, said Albert Camarillo, a Stanford University American history professor and historian. Some speakers suggested melting the bronze and commissioning local artists to repurpose the metal in a new statue more representative of San Jose\u2019s influential leaders of color. Some suggested moving the statue to a museum or local historical society where context could be given, and others proposed allowing Latino, indigenous and Black people to remove the statue. \u201cAs an immigrant, it makes me feel extremely unwanted and unwelcome,\u201d local high school student Valentina Coronel said in the Chronicle report, adding \u201cwe have basically destroyed the Native American, the Hispanic culture in the whole county. I see the remnants of the culture being erased quickly.\u201d \u201cEach time I see that, that\u2019s what I see: It\u2019s another example of colonization,\u201d Yolanda Guerra, a teacher at San Jose High School who lives in the neighborhood where the statue stands, said. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, who solicited evidence of Fallon\u2019s misdeeds, said it would cost about $400,000 to remove the statue and transport it elsewhere. Liccardo said in the Chronicle report: It\u2019s clear that many people strongly feel that Fallon has committed these horrible crimes. It would be helpful for us to have that record, and then we will have a very clear basis for saying \u2018let\u2019s move the statue.\u2019 In the meantime, I\u2019ll continue to listen to the community and be very open to the public process that results. The Chronicle reported: The statue is a \u2018permanent\u2019 piece of public art, so it has to go through a de-accession review process, which involves communicating with the artist and move through the Public Art Committee and Arts Commission, which can recommend the removal to the City Council. The City Council has that ultimate authority to de-accession a permanent artwork like the Fallon Statue, said Michael Ogilvie, San Jose\u2019s public art director. Camarillo told the Chronicle that to some Mexican Americans \u201cand to anyone that has a historical consciousness,\u201d the statue is seen as \u201cputting someone who is the manifestation of the worst elements of Manifest Destiny.\u201d \u201cIf it causes injury to some subset of a population in the public realm \u2014 Mexican Americans, Latinos constitute the largest minority in San Jose \u2014 if a subset of that population feels harmed, affected by that statue, which does what?\u201d Camarillo said, adding it \u201cshows that the United States was taken, that Mexican California was taken by a violent overthrow of the American Republic in 1846.

The state also built technology and training centers. National Guardsmen and airmen also participated in the Texas border security efforts. An April 2017 report published by the National Economics Editorial placed the cost of illegal immigration to Texas taxpayers at $12.36 billion per year, or 9.6 percent of the state\u2019s budget.

He has been destitute since 2006 when\u00a0he exposed his employer, Novartis, for bribing doctors to prescribe drugs.\u00a0His wife divorced him and alienated his daughter. I am raising $5000 for Dan. Here is how you can help. Big Pharma is not our friend. Dan had the moral courage to expose them. https://www.gofundme.com/manage/lets-help-dan-abshear-big-pharma-whistleblower \u201cThere is a pathologically intimate relationship between corporations and the U.S. government- their collusion is expressed in the revolving door. \u201c In the Spring of 2006, I became a pharmaceutical corporate whistle blower. In February of that year, I had recruited a law firm with experience in pharmaceutical whistle blower lawsuits in Boston, which is a top place to file and submit pharmaceutical whistle blower cases.\u00a0 They agreed to represent me after I submitted a ten page document to them I composed- explaining why the wrongdoing of my employer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, needed to be addressed.\u00a0 They represented me on complete contingency, which meant that they would not be paid if they did not succeed in the whistle blower lawsuit they were submitting for me. The law firm submitted the whistle blower lawsuit against Novartis in April of 2006.\u00a0 And it was filed under seal, which means that I and my legal council cannot discuss the case whatsoever.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trick played by the D.O.J., to eliminate the possibility of media contact. I made a trip to Boston in July of 2006 to be asked hundreds of questions by various relevant government entities, such as the department of health and human services.\u00a0 Also, in the center of a large table in a conference room, was a phone, with numerous attorney generals from various states- all there to hear my answers to the hundreds of questions I was asked one day, for 8 hours.\u00a0 I spoke with complete knowledge of the evidence, and with total honesty.  Continues \u2026 So white gentiles, how\u2019s that having a united cabal of Jews monopolizing all the banks/corporations (Communism) working out for you? WOMEN ARE ALWAYS WITH THE SUCCESSFUL !\nTHEREFORE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE SEDUCTION\nOF MEN !\none has to know from birth on that in this world\nyou cannot rely on anybody ! As a former whistleblower this article supports my years of contention that to ascend in any human institution, even in government and politics, you have to leave your conscience at the door. One can never regret serving the truth and what is right.  Henry\u2019s article also supports the view of just how morally corrupt all of our institutions really are, how the ends always justify the means to those in power, and that those at the so-called \u201ctop\u201d reflect by their deeds the very worst in our human natures.  Just this one example shows the corruption in major drug corporations, our government agencies, our flake politicians sitting in our useless legislatures, the medical community, the legal profession, and in our courts. There is not one spot on the carcass of our body politic which is not covered with putrid puss and sores, a body which has never suffered a cleansing bath much less any real purgation, and all coming from a completely filthy mind in control. Since they\u2019re likely to deplatform this GoFundMe account, I wouldn\u2019t use it\u2026.sorry Mr. Makow. Thankyou Henry this is one of his best articles\nhenry came in for a lot of criticism publishing such rot over Hitler\nbut now hes back on the truth\nwelcome back henry henry is one of the very few jews who has an\nunderstanding of the troubles of GOYIM .\nsame brother NATHANAEL . I\u2019m not surprised that whistleblowers find themselves on a secret blacklist. Decades ago I became unemployable in my local area. I don\u2019t remember exactly what my \u201ccrime\u201d had been. I certainly wasn\u2019t a whistleblower. I wasn\u2019t even a member of a trade union. All I can assume after so long is that it had something to do with my strong sense of injustice, whether committed against myself or another. I had a number of promising job interviews, but every one ended with a statement to the effect that there were other applicants, so \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know\u201d, but they never did. Around that time the local paper ran a story about claims made by others that the employment offices operated a blacklist. They denied this, of course, but they did admit that they would sometimes \u201cnot recommend\u201d certain people for employment and to have a secret number for potential employers to ring to learn about job applicants. If that\u2019s not blacklisting, I don\u2019t know what is. In the end I had to move away and find casual work using a false name until I discovered that this particular blacklist didn\u2019t extend to my new home town, by which time I\u2019d successfully built a reputation as the reliable worker I always had been. If there are blacklists operating at the local level involving low-level employment, it seems obvious to me that there would be something much more sinister and all-pervading at the \u201chigher end\u201d of the jobs market.

By twisting the historic meaning of the word \"sex\" in the Title IX education amendment of 1972 to include something other than biological \"male or female,\" Biden has created a monster! Under this socially-radical and disturbing Democrat decree, any educational institution that receives federal funding must now admit biologically-male athletes to women's teams, compete for women's scholarships, share locker rooms and other biologically-separated spaces, including forcing female members of our military to shower with biological men. Alliance Defending Freedom legal counsel Christiana Holcomb wrote that this reckless action will \"gut legal protections for women by denying female athletes fair competition in sports, ignoring women's unique health needs, and forcing vulnerable girls to share intimate spaces with men who identify as female.\" Parsing the consequences as simply as possible author Ryan Anderson explained: \"Boys who identify as girls must be allowed to compete in the girls' athletic competitions, men who identify as women must be allowed in women-only spaces, health care plans must pay for gender transition procedures and doctors and hospitals must perform them.\" Emilie Kao, an attorney with the Heritage Foundation, says America's new 46th president\u2014despite all his talk about \"unity\"\u2014has shown he is \"committed to advancing a radically divisive transgender agenda and has set women back decades.\" There is nothing \"equal\" in pitting biological boys against biological girls. The lunacy of this extreme, \"progressive\" political policy denies acknowledged reality from all of human history and \"established science\" that only two sexes\u2014male and female\u2014exist in the human race\" (Matt. 19:3; Gen. 1:27, 5:2)\u2014one or the other, not both. Chromosomes don't lie, nor are they confused. These gendered individuals may express their biological masculinity or femininity in varied and diverse ways, according to their unique physical and emotional makeup. They are each unique individuals of equal worth, purpose and value to our Creator God. Misguided Gendering The Bible clearly states, \"But from the beginning of the creation God 'made them male and female'\" (Mark 10:6). Christian author and Bible teacher Larry Tomczak correctly clarified, \"People can protest all they want, yet the Scriptures and scientific fact prove that men and women are different and men possess larger bones, lungs, bone density, muscle fiber and something called testosterone. This explains why the fastest female sprinter in the world, Allyson Felix, has a lifetime best in the 440-meter that was handily beaten by 300 high school boys in recent statistics.\" Sensuous and confusing times like these were described by the apostle Paul in key verses of Romans 1: Refusing to know God, they soon didn't know how to be human either\u2014women didn't know how to be women, men didn't know how to be men. Sexually confused, they abused and defiled one another, women with women, men with men\u2014all lust, no love. And then they paid for it, oh, how they paid for it\u2014emptied of God and love, godless and loveless wretches (Rom. 1:26-17, MSG). Unfortunately, many are reluctant to confront these radical, gender-ideologies and social changes directly for fear of being called hateful and hurtful names. They don't want to truthfully and objectively say that LGBTQ ideology and high-risk, sexual practices are harmful and destructive beliefs and behavior, based on junk science and sensual lust. In the name of \"equality,\" this executive order claims (without any scientific evidence) that there is no difference physically between biological boys and girls. It marginalizes women, confuses children and feminizes boys. In an op-ed in The Washington Post last year, three current or former female athletes\u2014Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova and Sanya Richards-Ross\u2014asserted: \"The evidence is unequivocal that, starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science.\" There is nothing \"equal\" or \"fair\" in pitting biological boys against biological girls. Chromosomes don't lie nor are they confused. This binary pair of individuals may express their biological masculinity and femininity in varied and diverse ways, according to their unique physical and emotional makeup. These gendered expressions are neither identical nor interchangeable but essential to God's creational plan. These physical differences are to be embraced as divine design. This is why males and females are (uniquely) equipped sexually to physically reproduce (Gen. 1:28, 2:20). They are biologically and emotionally equipped to fulfill a mutually-complementary and covenantal relationship before their Creator God (Eph. 5:21-33). This is why the apostle Paul challenges homosexual partnerships as deviating from the natural relations or natural function of male-female sexual intercourse (Rom. 1:26-27), as designed and ordained by our Creator God. The Bible clearly teaches that men should not act sexually as women (Lev. 18:22, Rom. 1:18-32, 1 Cor. 6:9-10) or dress like women (Deut. 22:5), and when men or women approve of or engage in other-gendered expressions of identity, it is a disgrace (1 Cor. 11:14-15). We do not have an inalienable right to do whatever we want with our physical selves. We are all made in the image of God and are to glorify Him in our bodies and in our spirits, which belong to Him, as our Creator (1 Cor. 6:12-20). The apostle Paul taught that God's wrath is revealed against those \"who suppress the truth through unrighteousness\" (Rom. 1:18). Tampering with God's created order will not go well\u2014whether for common sinners nor politicized legislators and presidents.

Who needs him? Not House of Cards, it turns out, as Netflix announced it is carrying on with production of the series without its now disgraced, former star. Spacey, who played President Frank Underwood on the hit show, was dropped from the series after numerous men came forward with allegations of sexual abuse and harassment including out gay actor Anthony Rapp. Rapp alleged Spacey tried to take advantage of him when he was just 14. Spacey then tried to deflect the issue by coming out as gay himself. The series has tapped Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear to take over as co-stars of the drama, likely hoping the big names can distract from the absence of its lead. Production resumed on Tuesday after a three-month hiatus, and Netflix announced the additions of Lane and Kinnear, who will play brother and sister, today. The show\u2019s co-star,\u00a0Robin Wright, who plays Claire Underwood, will also reportedly play a central role in this, the sixth and final season. It is expected to be released later this year, and will be eight episodes long, down from the usual 13, reports The New York Times. While the show\u2019s ratings have dipped in recent years, it is still considered one of Netflix\u2019s flagship shows, earning it numerous award nominations and wins. The retooling of the show will keep the company from having to pull the plug entirely, like it did with a planned original movie about Gore Vidal that was to star Spacey as the writer, and a Louis CK stand-up special. CK has also had his projects cancelled due to allegations of sexual misconduct. The moves have cost Netflix\u00a0$39 million\u00a0that David Wells, its chief financial officer, said was related to the \u201cthe societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Stay tuned to find out how they navigate Frank Underwood\u2019s sudden disappearance. \u201cI feel like this moment is way bigger than me.\u201d \u201cWhat this ACTUALLY tells me is how safe students feel in your classroom.\u201d \u201cSorry I don\u2019t have razr phone pics to prove it to you,\u201d the rapper joked.

Kylie Minogue has dropped the music video for her new single \u201cDancing.\u201d The song is the debut single from her new album \u201cGolden,\u201d which comes out on April 6. In the video, Minogue, 49, wears cowboy boots and sparkly Western-inspired outfits. She strums her guitar, also adorned with glitter, and partakes in some line dancing for the pop-country track. Minogue told Chris Evans at BBC Radio 2 that she was \u201cfragile\u201d working on the album, a possible reference to her recent breakup with\u00a0Joshua Sasse, and says she took inspiration from Nashville. \u201cIt was a really good time to be honest and work through everything, and give a snapshot of where I am in my life\u2026. A lot of it was done in Nashville, and that taught me about putting more story into the song\u2026. And then you can take that song and produce that any way you want,\u201d Minogue says.

The Middle Eastern country where Islam is the state religion will welcome soccer players, coaches and fans from all around the planet, beginning Nov. 20, for matches that will pit nation against nation. Qatar has promised to welcome LGBTQ foreigners, even as its own people are tortured and put to death for being who they are. On Monday, Qatar\u2019s ambassador to Germany got an earful from one of those men at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, according to a report by the Associated Press. Fan representative Dario Minden spoke in English directly to Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani, about who he is and who he loves, Minden told him to \u201cabolish the death penalty\u201d for homosexuality. \u201cI\u2019m a man and I love men. I do \u2014 please don\u2019t be shocked \u2014 have sex with other men. This is normal,\u201d Minden told Al Thani. \u201cSo, please get used to it, or stay out of football. Because the most important rule in football is, football is for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re lesbian, if you\u2019re gay. It\u2019s for everyone. For the boys. For the girls. And for everyone in between. \u201cSo, abolish the death penalty. Abolish all of the penalties regarding sexual and gender identity,\u201d he said. A representative of Germany's association of fan and ultra groups went on stage to speak to the DFB's conference on human rights in Qatar ahead of the World Cup.Here's his personal speech on LGBT rights in the country, addressed directly at Qatar's ambassador to Germany. pic.twitter.com/ODYZrsYWyq  Although organizers promised Al Thani an opportunity to respond, the Associated Press reports that portion of the conference was closed to the public and the news media and was not televised. Earlier, Al Thani reportedly complained to those assembled that the issue of human rights was a distraction from the World Cup, even though the event was titled, \u201cSport and Human Rights.\u201d \u201cWe all care about human rights,\u201d said Al Thani. \u201cBut I would have enjoyed (it) more if I saw some concentration not only on just one subject, but the enjoyment of football and the football effect on people around the world.\u201d More than 5,000 miles away in San Francisco, a gay Qatari physician has organized a petition to tell the land of his birth: Love Is Not A Crime. Doctor Nasser Mohamed decided to come out in 2010 following a visit to the U.S., and spent his residency in Connecticut before moving to California in 2015. Mohamed wrote in an op-ed published by Outsports last month that he has spent the last decade caring for the LGBTQ community in outpatient settings and growing as an activist. \u201cBeing an LGBT person is a criminal offense in the legal system in Qatarm as is sex between two men. There are state-sponsored conversion-therapy practices, and LGBT-affirming psychotherapy is not offered.\u201d He wrote how law enforcement uses media and chat rooms to find, jail and punish people for being LGBTQ. \u201cVisibility of the local LGBT community in Qatar, and the exposure of their treatment, are absolutely essential,\u201d Mohamed wrote. \u201cI am doing my part by speaking up.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: Find out about Mohamed\u2019s petition by clicking here. He is also raising money through a GoFundMe account to provide him with funding for his activism as well as security and protection.

Will impeachment change that? Trump\u2019s States of the Union speeches have been one of the few places in his presidency that mostly follow the standard presidential script. He delivers a speech prepared by speechwriters, talks about a variety of policy priorities and honors a special guest (a tradition started by Ronald Reagan). In form and function, it\u2019s all been almost normal.1 This year, of course, the context surrounding Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech is anything but normal. The U.S. Senate will likely acquit Trump on two articles of impeachment this week . So the question is: Will Trump stick to the usual script, or will he tackle impeachment head-on? There are arguments and precedents that point to both scenarios. In the past, presidents facing scandal or impeachment have pushed back by saying those things \u2014 Watergate or other scandals, etc. \u2014 are just distractions from important policy issues that voters care about. The State of the Union address offers presidents an opportunity to highlight those issues, keeping the focus on his policy agenda. On the other hand, the State of the Union also allows presidents to publicly spin an impeachment or scandal. The framing war between presidents and their political opponents can affect how the public perceives an impeachment, even if that doesn\u2019t seem like how the process should work. So which tactic has been chosen by presidents who have faced this situation before? Bill Clinton delivered the 1999 State of the Union Address just a month after the House voted on four articles of impeachment \u2014 passing two of them \u2014 and a few weeks before the Senate voted to acquit him. Despite some Democrats joining Republicans in calling for the president to postpone the address until after the impeachment process had finished, Clinton proceeded with the speech as scheduled. His address, on Jan. 19, emphasized a variety of policy priorities, including preserving Social Security and improving public education, and he touted his own administration\u2019s record in domestic and foreign policy. Clinton never mentioned impeachment. He did, however, make several references to national unity. In a discussion of racial inequality, Clinton emphasized the shared fate of a united country: Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America. He referred to bipartisan priorities like medical research, education and Middle East peace. These fit in with standard State of the Union items, especially during a period of divided government. But in that political environment, they also functioned as a signal that the country should move on. Richard Nixon took a different approach in his 1974 State of the Union address. In it, he asked Congress to end the investigations, saying that \u201cone year of Watergate is enough.\u201d (This plea was, of course, unsuccessful, and Nixon resigned about six months later.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLInNam9XQE Nixon\u2019s remarks also included a pledge to cooperate with the investigation and a commitment to follow precedent \u201cfrom George Washington to Lyndon B. Johnson\u201d to avoid weakening the office of the presidency. These presidents all took advantage of the platform provided by the address to highlight his role as head of state and national figure. They mentioned shared values, bipartisan priorities and national history. Trump might try to do the same thing. But while both Watergate and the Clinton impeachment engendered deep partisan divisions, Nixon and Clinton enjoyed some advantages that Trump doesn\u2019t. Unlike Trump, Clinton had high approval ratings during his impeachment. And Nixon held office before the today\u2019s era of polarization and hyper partisanship. In other words, they could lean into the trappings of the presidency and messages of national unity in their addresses in the hopes of expanding their political support \u2014 in a way that Trump cannot. Of course, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what Trump will say. But the State of the Union, along with almost everything else in national politics related to the Trump White House, has become a lot more partisan. As we noted last year, these addresses aren\u2019t especially effective at moving public opinion or passing legislation, and presidents end up speaking to their own parties. (The TV audience is likely to be partisans who are already favorable to the president.) Given that, Trump\u2019s poor (and incredibly steady) approval ratings and contemporary polarization, it\u2019s unlikely the State of the Union speech will change many minds about the Ukraine scandal, impeachment or the Trump presidency more generally. Still, while partisan attitudes tend to be fairly solidified \u2014 with Republicans approving of Trump and disapproving of impeachment \u2014 the State of the Union could provide a useful opportunity for the administration to frame impeachment, especially for GOP-leaning voters. Sure, Trump already has sky-high approval ratings among Republicans, but that, to some extent, papers over Trump\u2019s weakness with people who support him. More generally, impeachment has proven surprisingly popular, with a higher percentage of Americans supporting the process than disapproving of it on average since October. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s impeachment poll tracker shows that through January, more Americans approved of impeachment than disapproved. But a speech addressed to a mostly partisan audience allows him to describe the impeachment as a (failed) attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election (as his defenders in Congress have argued) and to activate a sense of partisan team identity. In other words, this State of the Union might end up more closely resembling a rally speech, which would be a big break with norms. Such an approach would be substantively different from that of both Nixon and Clinton, both of whom tried to link their speeches to larger national values and priorities. It would also potentially highlight the distance between how partisans on different sides view the impeachment case. But Trump is a highly divisive president in a deeply polarized era. The State of the Union is still a national, ceremonial address \u2013 but the president may find political benefit in embracing its partisan potential. That said, the content has still carried a distinctly Trumpian message. In 2019, the president warned the new Democratic majority in the House to avoid investigations \u201cif there is to be peace and legislation.\u201d In his 2018 address, he suggested that \u201cAmericans are dreamers, too,\u201d angering Democrats by employing a term often used for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and using it to justify immigration restrictions.

Johnson was the co-founder of what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s first trans organization, STAR (Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries) with Sylvia Rivera. Johnson became a prominent figure and icon for the LGBTQ movement in the immediate aftermath of the Stonewall Riots.

Cuomo\u2019s announcement came at the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Greater New York Gala. \u201cNew York state is the progressive capital of the nation, and while we are winning the legal battle for justice for the LGBTQ community, in many ways we are losing the broader war for equality,\u201d he remarked while decrying the record level of discrimination and hate crimes that have occurred within the Empire State. Within his 15-minute remarks, Cuomo called for a repeal of New York State\u2019s ban on paying surrogate mothers in favor of guideline measures that he believes will be an LGBTQ-friendly. He also expressed plans to streamline adoption policies within the state. \u201cMy goal has been to make New York State the leading champion in the nation for the LGBTQ community, to be the state that ended discrimination, bias, intolerance, and judgmentalism against members of the LGBTQ community,\u201d Cuomo said to the crowd.

Harris were also honored at the event. \u201cPersonally I feel they should let her have her opinions,\u201d Carter said of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d actors who have criticized Rowling\u2019s transphobia. Patricia Kent was once accused of a sexual relationship with a student. Now she\u2019s denouncing \u201cgrooming our children for immoral satanic worship.\u201d \u201cThey do not align with the family and faith values of the majority of parents.\u201d \u201cThat is a set up. We\u2019re going to get treated sh**ty and then get no tipped and possibly hate crimed.\u201d His message was clear: Do not let hate win. The MMA coach said he\u2019s just glad his kid isn\u2019t gay: \u201cGays have been very mean to me. They\u2019re bullies.\u201d Many accused the angry people of using the tweet as an excuse to boycott a company that supports trans people. \u201cThis is not a time to be afraid,\u201d one injured survivor said. \u201cThis is a time to come together.\u201d The Department of Defense provides gender-affirming surgeries for active-duty military personnel, but it denies this lifesaving care to dependents.", "entities": ["Governor of New York", "Andrew Cuomo", "Brooklyn", "Activism", "Marsha P.
